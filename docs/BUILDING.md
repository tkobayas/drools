# Building

## Prerequisites

- Java SDK 17 or 21 (OpenJDK recommended) — CI builds with both — and Git
- Docker — not strictly required, but needed by some integration tests
  (Testcontainers-based); those tests can be skipped
- For GraalVM native image builds, follow the
  [Quarkus guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image); on macOS,
  see [DEVELOP_ON_MACOS.md](./DEVELOP_ON_MACOS.md)

## Basic build

Build with Maven from the root:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

A full build with all tests takes a long time. Common ways to shorten the
cycle:

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `-DskipTests` | Skip unit and integration tests |
| `-DquickTests` | Formatting validation and unit tests only (skips invoker and archetype tests) |
| `-DskipITs` | Skip integration tests only (failsafe) |
| `-Dinvoker.skip=true` | Skip maven-invoker-based integration tests (e.g. in `kie-maven-plugin`) |
| `-Dquickly` | Skip most plugins and tests |
| `-Dfull` | Also build distribution modules (`fullProfile`) |

You can also build only the module you work on, plus what depends on it, with
standard Maven reactor flags (`-pl <module> -am` / `-amd`).

## Tests

- Unit tests run with surefire; integration tests run with failsafe and are
  named with a trailing `IT` (e.g. `SomethingIT.java`).
- Some tests assume an `en_US` locale. On machines with a different locale,
  activate the `test-en` profile: `-Ptest-en` or `-DTestEn`.
- Test coverage (Jacoco): `mvn clean verify -Ptest-coverage`, report under
  `target/site/jacoco/`.
- Quarkus modules: `@QuarkusTest` classes are unit tests (surefire),
  `@QuarkusIntegrationTest` classes are integration tests (failsafe,
  `*IT.java`). The two cannot be mixed in the same `integration-test` phase.
- Maven-invoker-based integration tests (which build real kjars with the KIE
  Maven plugin) support running a subset with `-Dinvoker.test=<pattern>`;
  their build logs land under `target/it/<module_name>/build.log`.

## Troubleshooting

- **`UnmappableCharacterException` during the build**: set
  `MAVEN_OPTS=-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` (as an environment variable, not a `mvn`
  argument) and rebuild.
- **Testcontainers fails with "Can not connect to Ryuk at localhost"** (seen
  with some Docker for Mac versions, or when privileged containers are not
  allowed): try `export TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true`.
- **Locale-dependent test failures**: use the `test-en` profile described
  above.
