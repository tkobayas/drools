Drools since version 6.0 introduced a new configuration and convention approach to building KIE bases, instead of using the programmatic builder approach of the 5.x series. Building Drools-based KIE project make use of Maven, and aligns with Maven practices. A KIE project or module is simply a Maven Java project or module; with an additional metadata file META-INF/kmodule.xml. The kmodule.xml file is the descriptor that selects resources to KIE bases and configures those KIE bases and sessions. While standard Maven can build and package KIE resources, it will not provide validation at build time. There is a Maven plugin (kie-maven-plugin) which is recommended to use to get build time validation. The plugin also generates many classes, making the runtime loading faster too. The example project layout and Maven POM descriptor is illustrated in the screenshot Figure 1. Example project layout and Maven POM KIE uses defaults to minimise the amount of configuration. With an empty kmodule.xml being the simplest configuration. There must always be a kmodule.xml file, even if empty, as it’s used for discovery of the JAR and its contents. Maven can either 'mvn install' to deploy a KieModule to the local machine, where all other applications on the local machine use it. Or it can 'mvn deploy' to push the KieModule to a remote Maven repository. Building the Application will pull in the KieModule and populate the local Maven repository in the process. Figure 2. Example project layout and Maven POM JARs can be deployed in one of two ways. Either added to the classpath, like any other JAR in a Maven dependency listing, or they can be dynamically loaded at runtime. KIE will scan the classpath to find all the JARs with a kmodule.xml in it. Each found JAR is represented by the KieModule interface. The terms classpath KieModule and dynamic KieModule are used to refer to the two loading approaches. While dynamic modules support side by side versioning, classpath modules do not. Further once a module is on the classpath, no other version may be loaded dynamically. Detailed references for the API are included in the next sections, the impatient can jump straight to the examples section, which is fairly self-explanatory on the different use cases. Figure 3. org.kie.api.core.builder A Kie Project has the structure of a normal Maven project with the only peculiarity of including a kmodule.xml file defining in a declaratively way the KieBases and KieSessions that can be created from it. This file has to be placed in the resources/META-INF folder of the Maven project while all the other Kie artifacts, such as DRL or Excel files, must be stored in the resources folder or in any other subfolder under it. Since meaningful defaults have been provided for all configuration aspects, the simplest kmodule.xml file can contain just an empty kmodule tag like the following: Example 1. An empty kmodule.xml file In this way the kmodule will contain one single default KieBase. All Kie assets stored under the resources folder, or any of its subfolders, will be compiled and added to it. To trigger the building of these artifacts it is enough to create a KieContainer for them. Figure 4. KieContainer For this simple case it is enough to create a KieContainer that reads the files to be built from the classpath: Example 2. Creating a KieContainer from the classpath KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieContainer kContainer = kieServices.getKieClasspathContainer(); KieServices is the interface from where it possible to access all the Kie building and runtime facilities: Figure 5. KieServices In this way all the Java sources and the Kie resources are compiled and deployed into the KieContainer which makes its contents available for use at runtime. As explained in the former section, the kmodule.xml file is the place where it is possible to declaratively configure the KieBase(s) and KieSession(s) that can be created from a KIE project. In particular a KieBase is a repository of all the application’s knowledge definitions. It will contain rules, processes, functions, and type models. The KieBase itself does not contain data; instead, sessions are created from the KieBase into which data can be inserted and from which process instances may be started. Creating the KieBase can be heavy, whereas session creation is very light, so it is recommended that KieBase be cached where possible to allow for repeated session creation. However end-users usually shouldn’t worry about it, because this caching mechanism is already automatically provided by the KieContainer. Figure 6. KieBase Conversely the KieSession stores and executes on the runtime data. It is created from the KieBase or more easily can be created directly from the KieContainer if it has been defined in the kmodule.xml file Figure 7. KieSession The kmodule.xml allows to define and configure one or more KieBases and for each KieBase all the different KieSessions that can be created from it, as showed by the follwing example: Example 3. A sample kmodule.xml file Here the tag contains a list of key-value pairs that are the optional properties used to configure the KieBases building process. For instance this sample kmodule.xml file defines an additional custom operator named supersetOf and implemented by the org.mycompany.SupersetOfEvaluatorDefinition class. After this 2 KieBases have been defined and it is possible to instance 2 different types of KieSessions from the first one, while only one from the second. A list of the attributes that can be defined on the kbase tag, together with their meaning and default values follows: Table 1. kbase Attributes Attribute name Default value Admitted values Meaning name none any The name with which retrieve this KieBase from the KieContainer. This is the only mandatory attribute. includes none any comma separated list A comma separated list of other KieBases contained in this kmodule. The artifacts of all these KieBases will be also included in this one. packages all any comma separated list By default all the Drools artifacts under the resources folder, at any level, are included into the KieBase. This attribute allows to limit the artifacts that will be compiled in this KieBase to only the ones belonging to the list of packages. default false true, false Defines if this KieBase is the default one for this module, so it can be created from the KieContainer without passing any name to it. There can be at most one default KieBase in each module. equalsBehavior identity identity, equality Defines the behavior of Drools when a new fact is inserted into the Working Memory. With identity it always create a new FactHandle unless the same object isn’t already present in the Working Memory, while with equality only if the newly inserted object is not equal (according to its equal method) to an already existing fact. eventProcessingMode cloud cloud, stream When compiled in cloud mode the KieBase treats events as normal facts, while in stream mode allow temporal reasoning on them. declarativeAgenda disabled disabled, enabled Defines if the Declarative Agenda is enabled or not. Similarly all attributes of the ksession tag (except of course the name) have meaningful default. They are listed and described in the following table: Table 2. ksession Attributes Attribute name Default value Admitted values Meaning name none any Unique name of this KieSession. Used to fetch the KieSession from the KieContainer. This is the only mandatory attribute. type stateful stateful, stateless A stateful session allows to iteratively work with the Working Memory, while a stateless one is a one-off execution of a Working Memory with a provided data set. default false true, false Defines if this KieSession is the default one for this module, so it can be created from the KieContainer without passing any name to it. In each module there can be at most one default KieSession for each type. clockType realtime realtime, pseudo Defines if events timestamps are determined by the system clock or by a pseudo clock controlled by the application. This clock is especially useful for unit testing temporal rules. beliefSystem simple simple, jtms, defeasible Defines the type of belief system used by the KieSession. As outlined in the former kmodule.xml sample, it is also possible to declaratively create on each KieSession a file (or a console) logger, one or more WorkItemHandlers and Calendars plus some listeners that can be of 3 different types: ruleRuntimeEventListener, agendaEventListener and processEventListener Having defined a kmodule.xml like the one in the former sample, it is now possible to simply retrieve the KieBases and KieSessions from the KieContainer using their names. Example 4. Retrieving KieBases and KieSessions from the KieContainer KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieContainer kContainer = kieServices.getKieClasspathContainer(); KieBase kBase1 = kContainer.getKieBase(\"KBase1\"); KieSession kieSession1 = kContainer.newKieSession(\"KSession2_1\"); StatelessKieSession kieSession2 = kContainer.newStatelessKieSession(\"KSession2_2\"); It has to be noted that since KSession2_1 and KSession2_2 are of 2 different types (the first is stateful, while the second is stateless) it is necessary to invoke 2 different methods on the KieContainer according to their declared type. If the type of the KieSession requested to the KieContainer doesn’t correspond with the one declared in the kmodule.xml file the KieContainer will throw a RuntimeException. Also since a KieBase and a KieSession have been flagged as default is it possible to get them from the KieContainer without passing any name. Example 5. Retrieving default KieBases and KieSessions from the KieContainer KieContainer kContainer = ... KieBase kBase1 = kContainer.getKieBase(); // returns KBase1 KieSession kieSession1 = kContainer.newKieSession(); // returns KSession2_1 Since a Kie project is also a Maven project the groupId, artifactId and version declared in the pom.xml file are used to generate a ReleaseId that uniquely identifies this project inside your application. This allows creation of a new KieContainer from the project by simply passing its ReleaseId to the KieServices. Example 6. Creating a KieContainer of an existing project by ReleaseId KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get(); ReleaseId releaseId = kieServices.newReleaseId( \"org.acme\", \"myartifact\", \"1.0\" ); KieContainer kieContainer = kieServices.newKieContainer( releaseId ); KieBase and KiePackage don’t support serialization since Drools 6. You need to build KieBase through KieContainer. On the other hand, KieSession can be marshalled/unmarshalled by KieMashaller. See Marshalling. The KIE plugin for Maven ensures that artifact resources are validated and pre-compiled, it is recommended that this is used at all times. To use the plugin simply add it to the build section of the Maven pom.xml and activate it by using packaging kjar. Example 7. Adding the KIE plugin to a Maven pom.xml and activating it kjar ... org.kie kie-maven-plugin ${version.org.drools} true The plugin comes with support for all the Drools/jBPM knowledge resources. However, in case you are using specific KIE annotations in your Java classes, like for example @kie.api.Position, you will need to add compile time dependency on kie-api into your project. We recommend to use the provided scope for all the additional KIE dependencies. That way the kjar stays as lightweight as possible, and not dependant on any particular KIE version. Building a KIE module without the Maven plugin will copy all the resources, as is, into the resulting JAR. When that JAR is loaded by the runtime, it will attempt to build all the resources then. If there are compilation issues it will return a null KieContainer. It also pushes the compilation overhead to the runtime. In general this is not recommended, and the Maven plugin should always be used. Drools has 3 types of engine dependency that aggregate a required collection of dependencies. drools-ruleunits-engine is the standard engine for rule units that enables an executable model. drools-engine is the standard engine for traditional DRL syntax that enables an executable model. drools-engine-classic is the old engine that utilizes an MVEL interpreter. The drools-engine-classic and drools-mvel are now deprecated, so use drools-ruleunits-engine or drools-engine instead. org.drools drools-engine drools-engine doesn’t contain drools-xml-support, because a Rule Unit use case doesn’t require kmodule.xml, so no need to process XML. In other words, you have to explicitly add the drools-xml-support dependency when you use kmodule.xml in your project with drools-engine. For example: org.drools drools-engine org.drools drools-xml-support When building and running Drools in a uber-jar (also known as a fat JAR or JAR with dependencies), for example created by the Maven Shade Plugin, you will need to maintain conflicting resources from all dependencies. For instance when depending on org.drools:drools-ecj in your build, the org.eclipse.jdt:ecj dependency is transitively added, and you might want to remove signature files from the ECJ artifact which would not match in the final artifact. In this case the Maven Shade Plugin could be configured as it follows: org.apache.maven.plugins maven-shade-plugin 3.1.0 package shade *:* META-INF/*.SF META-INF/*.DSA META-INF/*.RSA It is also possible to define the KieBases and KieSessions belonging to a KieModule programmatically instead of the declarative definition in the kmodule.xml file. The same programmatic API also allows in explicitly adding the file containing the Kie artifacts instead of automatically read them from the resources folder of your project. To do that it is necessary to create a KieFileSystem, a sort of virtual file system, and add all the resources contained in your project to it. Figure 8. KieFileSystem Like all other Kie core components you can obtain an instance of the KieFileSystem from the KieServices. The kmodule.xml configuration file must be added to the filesystem. This is a mandatory step. Kie also provides a convenient fluent API, implemented by the KieModuleModel, to programmatically create this file. Figure 9. KieModuleModel To do this in practice it is necessary to create a KieModuleModel from the KieServices, configure it with the desired KieBases and KieSessions, convert it in XML and add the XML to the KieFileSystem. This process is shown by the following example: Example 8. Creating a kmodule.xml programmatically and adding it to a KieFileSystem KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieModuleModel kieModuleModel = kieServices.newKieModuleModel(); KieBaseModel kieBaseModel1 = kieModuleModel.newKieBaseModel( \"KBase1 \") .setDefault( true ) .setEqualsBehavior( EqualityBehaviorOption.EQUALITY ) .setEventProcessingMode( EventProcessingOption.STREAM ); KieSessionModel ksessionModel1 = kieBaseModel1.newKieSessionModel( \"KSession1\" ) .setDefault( true ) .setType( KieSessionModel.KieSessionType.STATEFUL ) .setClockType( ClockTypeOption.get(\"realtime\") ); KieFileSystem kfs = kieServices.newKieFileSystem(); kfs.writeKModuleXML(kieModuleModel.toXML()); At this point it is also necessary to add to the KieFileSystem, through its fluent API, all others Kie artifacts composing your project. These artifacts have to be added in the same position of a corresponding usual Maven project. Example 9. Adding Kie artifacts to a KieFileSystem KieFileSystem kfs = ... kfs.write( \"src/main/resources/KBase1/ruleSet1.drl\", stringContainingAValidDRL ) .write( \"src/main/resources/dtable.xls\", kieServices.getResources().newInputStreamResource( dtableFileStream ) ); This example shows that it is possible to add the Kie artifacts both as plain Strings and as Resources. In the latter case the Resources can be created by the KieResources factory, also provided by the KieServices. The KieResources provides many convenient factory methods to convert an InputStream, a File, or a String representing a path of your file system to a Resource that can be managed by the KieFileSystem. Figure 10. KieResources URLResource is no longer available since Drools 8, to ensure a more reproducible knowledge base build (avoiding remote URLs) and for better security. If you used URLResource in the past, you can manage the local-fetch of the remote resource externally to your Drools application, so to limit Drools build concerns to local resources containing knowledge assets. Normally the type of a Resource can be inferred from the extension of the name used to add it to the KieFileSystem. However it also possible to not follow the Kie conventions about file extensions and explicitly assign a specific ResourceType to a Resource as shown below: Example 10. Creating and adding a Resource with an explicit type KieFileSystem kfs = ... kfs.write( \"src/main/resources/myDrl.txt\", kieServices.getResources().newInputStreamResource( drlStream ) .setResourceType(ResourceType.DRL) ); Add all the resources to the KieFileSystem and build it by passing the KieFileSystem to a KieBuilder Figure 11. KieBuilder When the contents of a KieFileSystem are successfully built, the resulting KieModule is automatically added to the KieRepository. The KieRepository is a singleton acting as a repository for all the available KieModules. Figure 12. KieRepository After this it is possible to create through the KieServices a new KieContainer for that KieModule using its ReleaseId. However, since in this case the KieFileSystem doesn’t contain any pom.xml file (it is possible to add one using the KieFileSystem.writePomXML method), Kie cannot determine the ReleaseId of the KieModule and assign to it a default one. This default ReleaseId can be obtained from the KieRepository and used to identify the KieModule inside the KieRepository itself. The following example shows this whole process. Example 11. Building the contents of a KieFileSystem and creating a KieContainer KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieFileSystem kfs = ... kieServices.newKieBuilder( kfs ).buildAll(); KieContainer kieContainer = kieServices.newKieContainer(kieServices.getRepository().getDefaultReleaseId()); At this point it is possible to get KieBases and create new KieSessions from this KieContainer exactly in the same way as in the case of a KieContainer created directly from the classpath. It is a best practice to check the compilation results. The KieBuilder reports compilation results of 3 different severities: ERROR, WARNING and INFO. An ERROR indicates that the compilation of the project failed and in the case no KieModule is produced and nothing is added to the KieRepository. WARNING and INFO results can be ignored, but are available for inspection. Example 12. Checking that a compilation didn’t produce any error KieBuilder kieBuilder = kieServices.newKieBuilder( kfs ).buildAll(); assertEquals( 0, kieBuilder.getResults().getMessages( Message.Level.ERROR ).size() ); In some cases, it is possible to change the default severity of a type of build result. For instance, when a new rule with the same name of an existing rule is added to a package, the default behavior is to replace the old rule by the new rule and report it as an INFO. This is probably ideal for most use cases, but in some deployments the user might want to prevent the rule update and report it as an error. Changing the default severity for a result type, configured like any other option in Drools, can be done by API calls, system properties or configuration files. As of this version, Drools supports configurable result severity for rule updates and function updates. To configure it using system properties or configuration files, the user has to use the following properties: Example 13. Setting the severity using properties // sets the severity of rule updates drools.kbuilder.severity.duplicateRule = // sets the severity of function updates drools.kbuilder.severity.duplicateFunction = The KieBase is a repository of all the application’s knowledge definitions. It will contain rules, processes, functions, and type models. The KieBase itself does not contain data; instead, sessions are created from the KieBase into which data can be inserted and from which process instances may be started. The KieBase can be obtained from the KieContainer containing the KieModule where the KieBase has been defined. Figure 13. KieBase When the KieBase needs to resolve types that are not in the default class loader, it will be necessary to create a KieBaseConfiguration with an additional class loader and pass it to KieContainer when creating a new KieBase from it. Example 14. Creating a new KieBase with a custom ClassLoader KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieBaseConfiguration kbaseConf = kieServices.newKieBaseConfiguration( null, MyType.class.getClassLoader() ); KieBase kbase = kieContainer.newKieBase( kbaseConf ); KieSessions will be discussed in more detail in section \"Running\". The KieBase creates and returns KieSession objects, and it may optionally keep references to those. When KieBase modifications occur those modifications are applied against the data in the sessions. This reference is a weak reference and it is also optional, which is controlled by a boolean flag. The KieScanner allows continuous monitoring of your Maven repository to check whether a new release of a Kie project has been installed. A new release is deployed in the KieContainer wrapping that project. The use of the KieScanner requires kie-ci.jar to be on the classpath. Figure 14. KieScanner A KieScanner can be registered on a KieContainer as in the following example. Example 15. Registering and starting a KieScanner on a KieContainer KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get(); ReleaseId releaseId = kieServices.newReleaseId( \"org.acme\", \"myartifact\", \"1.0-SNAPSHOT\" ); KieContainer kContainer = kieServices.newKieContainer( releaseId ); KieScanner kScanner = kieServices.newKieScanner( kContainer ); // Start the KieScanner polling the Maven repository every 10 seconds kScanner.start( 10000L ); In this example the KieScanner is configured to run with a fixed time interval, but it is also possible to run it on demand by invoking the scanNow() method on it. If the KieScanner finds, in the Maven repository, an updated version of the Kie project used by that KieContainer it automatically downloads the new version and triggers an incremental build of the new project. At this point, existing KieBases and KieSessions under the control of KieContainer will get automatically upgraded with it - specifically, those KieBases obtained with getKieBase() along with their related KieSessions, and any KieSession obtained directly with KieContainer.newKieSession() thus referencing the default KieBase. Additionally, from this moment on, all the new KieBases and KieSessions created from that KieContainer will use the new project version. Please notice however any existing KieBase which was obtained via newKieBase() before the KieScanner upgrade, and any of its related KieSessions, will not get automatically upgraded; this is because KieBases obtained via newKieBase() are not under the direct control of the KieContainer. The KieScanner will only pickup changes to deployed jars if it is using a SNAPSHOT, version range, the LATEST, or the RELEASE setting. Fixed versions will not automatically update at runtime. In case you don’t want to install a maven repository, it is also possible to have a KieScanner that works by simply fetching update from a folder of a plain file system. You can create such a KieScanner as simply as KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieScanner kScanner = kieServices.newKieScanner( kContainer, \"/myrepo/kjars\" ); where \"/myrepo/kjars\" will be the folder where the KieScanner will look for kjar updates. The jar files placed in this folder have to follow the maven convention and then have to be a name in the form {artifactId}-{versionId}.jar. Maven supports a number of mechanisms to manage versioning and dependencies within applications. Modules can be published with specific version numbers, or they can use the SNAPSHOT suffix. Dependencies can specify version ranges to consume, or take advantage of SNAPSHOT mechanism. StackOverflow provides a very good description for this, which is reproduced below. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30571/how-do-i-tell-maven-to-use-the-latest-version-of-a-dependency Since Maven 3.x metaversions RELEASE and LATEST are no longer supported for the sake of reproducible builds. See the POM Syntax section of the Maven book for more details. http://books.sonatype.com/mvnref-book/reference/pom-relationships-sect-pom-syntax.html http://books.sonatype.com/mvnref-book/reference/pom-relationships-sect-project-dependencies.html Here’s an example illustrating the various options. In the Maven repository, com.foo:my-foo has the following metadata: com.foo my-foo 2.0.0 1.1.1 1.0 1.0.1 1.1 1.1.1 2.0.0 20090722140000 If a dependency on that artifact is required, you have the following options (other version ranges can be specified of course, just showing the relevant ones here): Declare an exact version (will always resolve to 1.0.1): [1.0.1] Declare an explicit version (will always resolve to 1.0.1 unless a collision occurs, when Maven will select a matching version): 1.0.1 Declare a version range for all 1.x (will currently resolve to 1.1.1): [1.0.0,2.0.0) Declare an open-ended version range (will resolve to 2.0.0): [1.0.0,) Declare the version as LATEST (will resolve to 2.0.0): LATEST Declare the version as RELEASE (will resolve to 1.1.1): RELEASE Note that by default your own deployments will update the \"latest\" entry in the Maven metadata, but to update the \"release\" entry, you need to activate the \"release-profile\" from the Maven super POM. You can do this with either \"-Prelease-profile\" or \"-DperformRelease=true\" The maven settings.xml is used to configure Maven execution. Detailed instructions can be found at the Maven website: http://maven.apache.org/settings.html The settings.xml file can be located in 3 locations, the actual settings used is a merge of those 3 locations. The Maven install: $M2_HOME/conf/settings.xml A user’s install: ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml Folder location specified by the system property kie.maven.settings.custom The settings.xml is used to specify the location of remote repositories. It is important that you activate the profile that specifies the remote repository, typically this can be done using \"activeByDefault\": profile-1 true ... Maven provides detailed documentation on using multiple remote repositories: http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html The KieBase is a repository of all the application’s knowledge definitions. It will contain rules, processes, functions, and type models. The KieBase itself does not contain data; instead, sessions are created from the KieBase into which data can be inserted and from which process instances may be started. The KieBase can be obtained from the KieContainer containing the KieModule where the KieBase has been defined. Example 16. Getting a KieBase from a KieContainer KieBase kBase = kContainer.getKieBase(); The KieSession stores and executes on the runtime data. It is created from the KieBase. Figure 15. KieSession Example 17. Create a KieSession from a KieBase KieSession ksession = kbase.newKieSession(); The KieRuntime provides methods that are applicable to both rules and processes, such as setting globals and registering channels. (\"Exit point\" is an obsolete synonym for \"channel\".) Figure 16. KieRuntime Globals are named objects that are made visible to the Drools rule engine, but in a way that is fundamentally different from the one for facts: changes in the object backing a global do not trigger reevaluation of rules. Still, globals are useful for providing static information, as an object offering services that are used in the RHS of a rule, or as a means to return objects from the Drools rule engine. When you use a global on the LHS of a rule, make sure it is immutable, or, at least, don’t expect changes to have any effect on the behavior of your rules. A global must be declared in a rules file, and then it needs to be backed up with a Java object. global java.util.List list With the KIE base now aware of the global identifier and its type, it is now possible to call ksession.setGlobal() with the global’s name and an object, for any session, to associate the object with the global. Failure to declare the global type and identifier in DRL code will result in an exception being thrown from this call. List list = new ArrayList<>(); ksession.setGlobal(\"list\", list); Make sure to set any global before it is used in the evaluation of a rule. Failure to do so results in a NullPointerException. The event package provides means to be notified of Drools rule engine events, including rules firing, objects being asserted, etc. This allows separation of logging and auditing activities from the main part of your application (and the rules). The KieRuntimeEventManager interface is implemented by the KieRuntime which provides two interfaces, RuleRuntimeEventManager and ProcessEventManager. We will only cover the RuleRuntimeEventManager here. Figure 17. KieRuntimeEventManager The RuleRuntimeEventManager allows for listeners to be added and removed, so that events for the working memory and the agenda can be listened to. Figure 18. RuleRuntimeEventManager The following code snippet shows how a simple agenda listener is declared and attached to a session. It will print matches after they have fired. Example 18. Adding an AgendaEventListener ksession.addEventListener( new DefaultAgendaEventListener() { public void afterMatchFired(AfterMatchFiredEvent event) { super.afterMatchFired( event ); System.out.println( event ); } }); Drools also provides DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener and DebugAgendaEventListener which implement each method with a debug print statement. To print all Working Memory events, you add a listener like this: Example 19. Adding a DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener ksession.addEventListener( new DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener() ); All emitted events implement the KieRuntimeEvent interface which can be used to retrieve the actual KnowlegeRuntime the event originated from. Figure 19. KieRuntimeEvent The events currently supported are: MatchCreatedEvent MatchCancelledEvent BeforeMatchFiredEvent AfterMatchFiredEvent AgendaGroupPushedEvent AgendaGroupPoppedEvent ObjectInsertEvent ObjectDeletedEvent ObjectUpdatedEvent ProcessCompletedEvent ProcessNodeLeftEvent ProcessNodeTriggeredEvent ProcessStartEvent The KieRuntimeLogger uses the comprehensive event system in Drools to create an audit log that can be used to log the execution of an application for later inspection, using tools such as the Eclipse audit viewer. Figure 20. KieLoggers Example 20. FileLogger KieRuntimeLogger logger = KieServices.Factory.get().getLoggers().newFileLogger(ksession, \"logdir/mylogfile\"); ... logger.close(); KIE has the concept of stateful or stateless sessions. Stateful sessions have already been covered, which use the standard KieRuntime, and can be worked with iteratively over time. Stateless is a one-off execution of a KieRuntime with a provided data set. It may return some results, with the session being disposed at the end, prohibiting further iterative interactions. You can think of stateless as treating an engine like a function call with optional return results. The foundation for this is the CommandExecutor interface, which both the stateful and stateless interfaces extend. This returns an ExecutionResults: Figure 21. CommandExecutor Figure 22. ExecutionResults The CommandExecutor allows for commands to be executed on those sessions, the only difference being that the StatelessKieSession executes fireAllRules() at the end before disposing the session. The commands can be created using the CommandExecutor .The Javadocs provide the full list of the allowed commands using the CommandExecutor. setGlobal and getGlobal are two commands relevant to both Drools and jBPM. Set Global calls setGlobal underneath. The optional boolean indicates whether the command should return the global’s value as part of the ExecutionResults. If true it uses the same name as the global name. A String can be used instead of the boolean, if an alternative name is desired. Example 21. Set Global Command StatelessKieSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKieSession(); ExecutionResults bresults = ksession.execute( CommandFactory.newSetGlobal( \"stilton\", new Cheese( \"stilton\" ), true); Cheese stilton = bresults.getValue( \"stilton\" ); Allows an existing global to be returned. The second optional String argument allows for an alternative return name. Example 22. Get Global Command StatelessKieSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKieSession(); ExecutionResults bresults = ksession.execute( CommandFactory.getGlobal( \"stilton\" ); Cheese stilton = bresults.getValue( \"stilton\" ); All the previous examples execute single commands. The BatchExecution represents a composite command, created from a list of commands. It will iterate over the list and execute each command in turn. This means you can insert some objects, start a process, call fireAllRules and execute a query, all in a single execute(…​) call, which is quite powerful. The StatelessKieSession will execute fireAllRules() automatically at the end. However the keen-eyed reader probably has already noticed the FireAllRules command and wondered how that works with a StatelessKieSession. The FireAllRules command is allowed, and using it will disable the automatic execution at the end; think of using it as a sort of manual override function. Any command, in the batch, that has an out identifier set will add its results to the returned ExecutionResults instance. Let’s look at a simple example to see how this works. The example presented includes command from the Drools and jBPM, for the sake of illustration. They are covered in more detail in the Drool and jBPM specific sections. Example 23. BatchExecution Command StatelessKieSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKieSession(); List cmds = new ArrayList(); cmds.add( CommandFactory.newInsertObject( new Cheese( \"stilton\", 1), \"stilton\") ); cmds.add( CommandFactory.newStartProcess( \"process cheeses\" ) ); cmds.add( CommandFactory.newQuery( \"cheeses\" ) ); ExecutionResults bresults = ksession.execute( CommandFactory.newBatchExecution( cmds ) ); Cheese stilton = ( Cheese ) bresults.getValue( \"stilton\" ); QueryResults qresults = ( QueryResults ) bresults.getValue( \"cheeses\" ); In the previous example multiple commands are executed, two of which populate the ExecutionResults. The query command defaults to use the same identifier as the query name, but it can also be mapped to a different identifier. The StatelessKieSession wraps the KieSession, instead of extending it. Its main focus is on the decision service type scenarios. It avoids the need to call dispose(). Stateless sessions do not support iterative insertions and the method call fireAllRules() from Java code; the act of calling execute() is a single-shot method that will internally instantiate a KieSession, add all the user data and execute user commands, call fireAllRules(), and then call dispose(). While the main way to work with this class is via the BatchExecution (a subinterface of Command) as supported by the CommandExecutor interface, two convenience methods are provided for when simple object insertion is all that’s required. The CommandExecutor and BatchExecution are talked about in detail in their own section. Figure 23. StatelessKieSession Our simple example shows a stateless session executing a given collection of Java objects using the convenience API. It will iterate the collection, inserting each element in turn. Example 24. Simple StatelessKieSession execution with a Collection StatelessKieSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKieSession(); ksession.execute( collection ); If this was done as a single Command it would be as follows: Example 25. Simple StatelessKieSession execution with InsertElements Command ksession.execute( CommandFactory.newInsertElements( collection ) ); If you wanted to insert the collection itself, and the collection’s individual elements, then CommandFactory.newInsert(collection) would do the job. Methods of the CommandFactory create the supported commands, all of which can be marshalled using XStream and the BatchExecutionHelper. BatchExecutionHelper provides details on the XML format as well as how to use Drools Pipeline to automate the marshalling of BatchExecution and ExecutionResults. StatelessKieSession supports globals, scoped in a number of ways. We cover the non-command way first, as commands are scoped to a specific execution call. Globals can be resolved in three ways. The StatelessKieSession method getGlobals() returns a Globals instance which provides access to the session’s globals. These are used for all execution calls. Exercise caution regarding mutable globals because execution calls can be executing simultaneously in different threads. Example 26. Session scoped global StatelessKieSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKieSession(); // Set a global hbnSession, that can be used for DB interactions in the rules. ksession.setGlobal( \"hbnSession\", hibernateSession ); // Execute while being able to resolve the \"hbnSession\" identifier. ksession.execute( collection ); Using a delegate is another way of global resolution. Assigning a value to a global (with setGlobal(String, Object)) results in the value being stored in an internal collection mapping identifiers to values. Identifiers in this internal collection will have priority over any supplied delegate. Only if an identifier cannot be found in this internal collection, the delegate global (if any) will be used. The third way of resolving globals is to have execution scoped globals. Here, a Command to set a global is passed to the CommandExecutor. The CommandExecutor interface also offers the ability to export data via \"out\" parameters. Inserted facts, globals and query results can all be returned. Example 27. Out identifiers // Set up a list of commands List cmds = new ArrayList(); cmds.add( CommandFactory.newSetGlobal( \"list1\", new ArrayList(), true ) ); cmds.add( CommandFactory.newInsert( new Person( \"jon\", 102 ), \"person\" ) ); cmds.add( CommandFactory.newQuery( \"Get People\", \"getPeople\" ) ); // Execute the list ExecutionResults results = ksession.execute( CommandFactory.newBatchExecution( cmds ) ); // Retrieve the ArrayList results.getValue( \"list1\" ); // Retrieve the inserted Person fact results.getValue( \"person\" ); // Retrieve the query as a QueryResults instance. results.getValue( \"Get People\" ); The KieMarshallers are used to marshal and unmarshal KieSessions. Figure 24. KieMarshallers An instance of the KieMarshallers can be retrieved from the KieServices. A simple example is shown below: Example 28. Simple Marshaller Example // ksession is the KieSession // kbase is the KieBase ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream(); Marshaller marshaller = KieServices.Factory.get().getMarshallers().newMarshaller( kbase ); marshaller.marshall( baos, ksession ); baos.close(); However, with marshalling, you will need more flexibility when dealing with referenced user data. To achieve this use the ObjectMarshallingStrategy interface. Two implementations are provided, but users can implement their own. The two supplied strategies are IdentityMarshallingStrategy and SerializeMarshallingStrategy. SerializeMarshallingStrategy is the default, as shown in the example above, and it just calls the Serializable or Externalizable methods on a user instance. IdentityMarshallingStrategy creates an integer id for each user object and stores them in a Map, while the id is written to the stream. When unmarshalling it accesses the IdentityMarshallingStrategy map to retrieve the instance. This means that if you use the IdentityMarshallingStrategy, it is stateful for the life of the Marshaller instance and will create ids and keep references to all objects that it attempts to marshal. Below is the code to use an Identity Marshalling Strategy. Example 29. IdentityMarshallingStrategy ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream(); KieMarshallers kMarshallers = KieServices.Factory.get().getMarshallers() ObjectMarshallingStrategy oms = kMarshallers.newIdentityMarshallingStrategy() Marshaller marshaller = kMarshallers.newMarshaller( kbase, new ObjectMarshallingStrategy[]{ oms } ); marshaller.marshall( baos, ksession ); baos.close(); In most cases, a single strategy is insufficient. For added flexibility, the ObjectMarshallingStrategyAcceptor interface can be used. This Marshaller has a chain of strategies, and while reading or writing a user object it iterates the strategies asking if they accept responsibility for marshalling the user object. One of the provided implementations is ClassFilterAcceptor. This allows strings and wild cards to be used to match class names. The default is \".\", so in the previous example the Identity Marshalling Strategy is used which has a default \".\" acceptor. Assuming that we want to serialize all classes except for one given package, where we will use identity lookup, we could do the following: Example 30. IdentityMarshallingStrategy with Acceptor ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream(); KieMarshallers kMarshallers = KieServices.Factory.get().getMarshallers() ObjectMarshallingStrategyAcceptor identityAcceptor = kMarshallers.newClassFilterAcceptor( new String[] { \"org.domain.pkg1.*\" } ); ObjectMarshallingStrategy identityStrategy = kMarshallers.newIdentityMarshallingStrategy( identityAcceptor ); ObjectMarshallingStrategy sms = kMarshallers.newSerializeMarshallingStrategy(); Marshaller marshaller = kMarshallers.newMarshaller( kbase, new ObjectMarshallingStrategy[]{ identityStrategy, sms } ); marshaller.marshall( baos, ksession ); baos.close(); Note that the acceptance checking order is in the natural order of the supplied elements. Longterm out of the box persistence with Java Persistence API (JPA) is possible with Drools. It is necessary to have some implementation of the Java Transaction API (JTA) installed. For development purposes the Bitronix Transaction Manager is suggested, as it’s simple to set up and works embedded, but for production use JBoss Transactions is recommended. Example 31. Simple example using transactions KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get(); Environment env = kieServices.newEnvironment(); env.set( EnvironmentName.ENTITY_MANAGER_FACTORY, Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory( \"emf-name\" ) ); env.set( EnvironmentName.TRANSACTION_MANAGER, TransactionManagerServices.getTransactionManager() ); // KieSessionConfiguration may be null, and a default will be used KieSession ksession = kieServices.getStoreServices().newKieSession( kbase, null, env ); int sessionId = ksession.getId(); UserTransaction ut = (UserTransaction) new InitialContext().lookup( \"java:comp/UserTransaction\" ); ut.begin(); ksession.insert( data1 ); ksession.insert( data2 ); ksession.startProcess( \"process1\" ); ut.commit(); To use a JPA, the Environment must be set with both the EntityManagerFactory and the TransactionManager. If rollback occurs the ksession state is also rolled back, hence it is possible to continue to use it after a rollback. To load a previously persisted KieSession you’ll need the id, as shown below: Example 32. Loading a KieSession KieSession ksession = kieServices.getStoreServices().loadKieSession( sessionId, kbase, null, env ); To enable persistence several classes must be added to your persistence.xml, as in the example below: Example 33. Configuring JPA org.hibernate.ejb.HibernatePersistence jdbc/BitronixJTADataSource org.drools.persistence.info.SessionInfo org.drools.persistence.info.WorkItemInfo The jdbc JTA data source would have to be configured first. Bitronix provides a number of ways of doing this, and its documentation should be consulted for details. For a quick start, here is the programmatic approach: Example 34. Configuring JTA DataSource PoolingDataSource fs = new PoolingDataSource(); fs.setUniqueName( \"jdbc/BitronixJTADataSource\" ); fs.setClassName( \"org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource\" ); fs.setMaxPoolSize( 3 ); fs.setAllowLocalTransactions( true ); fs.getDriverProperties().put( \"user\", \"sa\" ); fs.getDriverProperties().put( \"password\", \"sasa\" ); fs.getDriverProperties().put( \"URL\", \"jdbc:h2:mem:mydb\" ); fs.init(); Bitronix also provides a simple embedded JNDI service, ideal for testing. To use it, add a jndi.properties file to your META-INF folder and add the following line to it: Example 35. JNDI properties java.naming.factory.initial=bitronix.tm.jndi.BitronixInitialContextFactory The best way to learn the new build system is by example. The source project \"drools-examples-api\" contains a number of examples, and can be found at GitHub: https://github.com/kiegroup/drools/tree/main/drools-examples-api Each example is described below, the order starts with the simplest (most of the options are defaulted) and working its way up to more complex use cases. The Deploy use cases shown below all involve mvn install. Remote deployment of JARs in Maven is well covered in Maven literature. Utilize refers to the initial act of loading the resources and providing access to the KIE runtimes. Whereas Run refers to the act of interacting with those runtimes. Project: default-kesession. Summary: Empty kmodule.xml KieModule on the classpath that includes all resources in a single default KieBase. The example shows the retrieval of the default KieSession from the classpath. An empty kmodule.xml will produce a single KieBase that includes all files found under resources path, be it DRL, BPMN2, XLS etc. That single KieBase is the default and also includes a single default KieSession. Default means they can be created without knowing their names. Example 36. Author - kmodule.xml Example 37. Build and Install - Maven mvn install ks.getKieClasspathContainer() returns the KieContainer that contains the KieBases deployed onto the environment classpath. kContainer.newKieSession() creates the default KieSession. Notice that you no longer need to look up the KieBase, in order to create the KieSession. The KieSession knows which KieBase it’s associated with, and use that, which in this case is the default KieBase. Example 38. Utilize and Run - Java KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieContainer kContainer = ks.getKieClasspathContainer(); KieSession kSession = kContainer.newKieSession(); kSession.setGlobal(\"out\", out); kSession.insert(new Message(\"Dave\", \"Hello, HAL. Do you read me, HAL?\")); kSession.fireAllRules(); Project: named-kiesession. Summary: kmodule.xml that has one named KieBase and one named KieSession. The examples shows the retrieval of the named KieSession from the classpath. kmodule.xml will produce a single named KieBase, 'kbase1' that includes all files found under resources path, be it DRL, BPMN2, XLS etc. KieSession 'ksession1' is associated with that KieBase and can be created by name. Example 39. Author - kmodule.xml Example 40. Build and Install - Maven mvn install ks.getKieClasspathContainer() returns the KieContainer that contains the KieBases deployed onto the environment classpath. This time the KieSession uses the name 'ksession1'. You do not need to lookup the KieBase first, as it knows which KieBase 'ksession1' is assocaited with. Example 41. Utilize and Run - Java KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieContainer kContainer = ks.getKieClasspathContainer(); KieSession kSession = kContainer.newKieSession(\"ksession1\"); kSession.setGlobal(\"out\", out); kSession.insert(new Message(\"Dave\", \"Hello, HAL. Do you read me, HAL?\")); kSession.fireAllRules(); Project: kiebase-inclusion. Summary: 'kmodule.xml' demonstrates that one KieBase can include the resources from another KieBase, from another KieModule. In this case it inherits the named KieBase from the 'name-kiesession' example. The included KieBase can be from the current KieModule or any other KieModule that is in the pom.xml dependency list. kmodule.xml will produce a single named KieBase, 'kbase2' that includes all files found under resources path, be it DRL, BPMN2, XLS etc. Further it will include all the resources found from the KieBase 'kbase1', due to the use of the 'includes' attribute. KieSession 'ksession2' is associated with that KieBase and can be created by name. Example 42. Author - kmodule.xml This example requires that the previous example, 'named-kiesession', is built and installed to the local Maven repository first. Once installed it can be included as a dependency, using the standard Maven element. Example 43. Author - pom.xml 4.0.0 org.drools drools-examples-api 6.0.0/version> kiebase-inclusion Drools API examples - KieBase Inclusion org.drools drools-compiler org.drools named-kiesession 6.0.0 Once 'named-kiesession' is built and installed this example can be built and installed as normal. Again the act of installing, will force the unit tests to run, demonstrating the use case. Example 44. Build and Install - Maven mvn install ks.getKieClasspathContainer() returns the KieContainer that contains the KieBases deployed onto the environment classpath. This time the KieSession uses the name 'ksession2'. You do not need to lookup the KieBase first, as it knows which KieBase 'ksession1' is assocaited with. Notice two rules fire this time, showing that KieBase 'kbase2' has included the resources from the dependency KieBase 'kbase1'. Example 45. Utilize and Run - Java KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieContainer kContainer = ks.getKieClasspathContainer(); KieSession kSession = kContainer.newKieSession(\"ksession2\"); kSession.setGlobal(\"out\", out); kSession.insert(new Message(\"Dave\", \"Hello, HAL. Do you read me, HAL?\")); kSession.fireAllRules(); kSession.insert(new Message(\"Dave\", \"Open the pod bay doors, HAL.\")); kSession.fireAllRules(); Project: 'multiple-kbases. Summary: Demonstrates that the 'kmodule.xml' can contain any number of KieBase or KieSession declarations. Introduces the 'packages' attribute to select the folders for the resources to be included in the KieBase. kmodule.xml produces 6 different named KieBases. 'kbase1' includes all resources from the KieModule. The other KieBases include resources from other selected folders, via the 'packages' attribute. Note the use of wildcard '*', to select this package and all packages below it. Example 46. Author - kmodule.xml Example 47. Build and Install - Maven mvn install Only part of the example is included below, as there is a test method per KieSession, but each one is a repetition of the other, with different list expectations. Example 48. Utilize and Run - Java @Test public void testSimpleKieBase() { List list = useKieSession(\"ksession1\"); // no packages imported means import everything assertEquals(4, list.size()); assertTrue( list.containsAll( asList(0, 1, 2, 3) ) ); } //.. other tests for ksession2 to ksession6 here private List useKieSession(String name) { KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieContainer kContainer = ks.getKieClasspathContainer(); KieSession kSession = kContainer.newKieSession(name); List list = new ArrayList(); kSession.setGlobal(\"list\", list); kSession.insert(1); kSession.fireAllRules(); return list; } Project: kcontainer-from-repository Summary: The project does not contain a kmodule.xml, nor does the pom.xml have any dependencies for other KieModules. Instead the Java code demonstrates the loading of a dynamic KieModule from a Maven repository. The pom.xml must include kie-ci as a dependency, to ensure Maven is available at runtime. As this uses Maven under the hood you can also use the standard Maven settings.xml file. Example 49. Author - pom.xml 4.0.0 org.drools drools-examples-api 6.0.0 kiecontainer-from-kierepo Drools API examples - KieContainer from KieRepo org.kie kie-ci Example 50. Build and Install - Maven mvn install In the previous examples the classpath KieContainer used. This example creates a dynamic KieContainer as specified by the ReleaseId. The ReleaseId uses Maven conventions for group id, artifact id and version. It also obeys LATEST and SNAPSHOT for versions. Example 51. Utilize and Run - Java KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); // Install example1 in the local Maven repo before to do this KieContainer kContainer = ks.newKieContainer(ks.newReleaseId(\"org.drools\", \"named-kiesession\", \"6.0.0-SNAPSHOT\")); KieSession kSession = kContainer.newKieSession(\"ksession1\"); kSession.setGlobal(\"out\", out); Object msg1 = createMessage(kContainer, \"Dave\", \"Hello, HAL. Do you read me, HAL?\"); kSession.insert(msg1); kSession.fireAllRules(); Project: default-kiesession-from-file Summary: Dynamic KieModules can also be loaded from any Resource location. The loaded KieModule provides default KieBase and KieSession definitions. No kmodue.xml file exists. The project 'default-kiesession' must be built first, so that the resulting JAR, in the target folder, can be referenced as a File. Example 52. Build and Install - Maven mvn install Any KieModule can be loaded from a Resource location and added to the KieRepository. Once deployed in the KieRepository it can be resolved via its ReleaseId. Note neither Maven or kie-ci are needed here. It will not set up a transitive dependency parent classloader. Example 53. Utilize and Run - Java KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieRepository kr = ks.getRepository(); KieModule kModule = kr.addKieModule(ks.getResources().newFileSystemResource(getFile(\"default-kiesession\"))); KieContainer kContainer = ks.newKieContainer(kModule.getReleaseId()); KieSession kSession = kContainer.newKieSession(); kSession.setGlobal(\"out\", out); Object msg1 = createMessage(kContainer, \"Dave\", \"Hello, HAL. Do you read me, HAL?\"); kSession.insert(msg1); kSession.fireAllRules(); Project: named-kiesession-from-file Summary: Dynamic KieModules can also be loaded from any Resource location. The loaded KieModule provides named KieBase and KieSession definitions. No kmodue.xml file exists. The project 'named-kiesession' must be built first, so that the resulting JAR, in the target folder, can be referenced as a File. Example 54. Build and Install - Maven mvn install Any KieModule can be loaded from a Resource location and added to the KieRepository. Once in the KieRepository it can be resolved via its ReleaseId. Note neither Maven or kie-ci are needed here. It will not setup a transitive dependency parent classloader. Example 55. Utilize and Run - Java KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieRepository kr = ks.getRepository(); KieModule kModule = kr.addKieModule(ks.getResources().newFileSystemResource(getFile(\"named-kiesession\"))); KieContainer kContainer = ks.newKieContainer(kModule.getReleaseId()); KieSession kSession = kContainer.newKieSession(\"ksession1\"); kSession.setGlobal(\"out\", out); Object msg1 = createMessage(kContainer, \"Dave\", \"Hello, HAL. Do you read me, HAL?\"); kSession.insert(msg1); kSession.fireAllRules(); Project: kie-module-form-multiple-files Summary: Programmatically provide the list of dependant KieModules, without using Maven to resolve anything. No kmodue.xml file exists. The projects 'named-kiesession' and 'kiebase-include' must be built first, so that the resulting JARs, in the target folders, can be referenced as Files. Example 56. Build and Install - Maven mvn install Creates two resources. One is for the main KieModule 'exRes1' the other is for the dependency 'exRes2'. Even though kie-ci is not present and thus Maven is not available to resolve the dependencies, this shows how you can manually specify the dependent KieModules, for the vararg. Example 57. Utilize and Run - Java KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieRepository kr = ks.getRepository(); Resource ex1Res = ks.getResources().newFileSystemResource(getFile(\"kiebase-inclusion\")); Resource ex2Res = ks.getResources().newFileSystemResource(getFile(\"named-kiesession\")); KieModule kModule = kr.addKieModule(ex1Res, ex2Res); KieContainer kContainer = ks.newKieContainer(kModule.getReleaseId()); KieSession kSession = kContainer.newKieSession(\"ksession2\"); kSession.setGlobal(\"out\", out); Object msg1 = createMessage(kContainer, \"Dave\", \"Hello, HAL. Do you read me, HAL?\"); kSession.insert(msg1); kSession.fireAllRules(); Object msg2 = createMessage(kContainer, \"Dave\", \"Open the pod bay doors, HAL.\"); kSession.insert(msg2); kSession.fireAllRules(); Project: kiemoduelmodel-example Summary: Programmatically build a KieModule from just a single file. The POM and models are all defaulted. This is the quickest out of the box approach, but should not be added to a Maven repository. Example 58. Build and Install - Maven mvn install This programmatically builds a KieModule. It populates the model that represents the ReleaseId and kmodule.xml, and it adds the relevant resources. A pom.xml is generated from the ReleaseId. Example 59. Utilize and Run - Java KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieRepository kr = ks.getRepository(); KieFileSystem kfs = ks.newKieFileSystem(); kfs.write(\"src/main/resources/org/kie/example5/HAL5.drl\", getRule()); KieBuilder kb = ks.newKieBuilder(kfs); kb.buildAll(); // kieModule is automatically deployed to KieRepository if successfully built. if (kb.getResults().hasMessages(Level.ERROR)) { throw new RuntimeException(\"Build Errors:\\n\" + kb.getResults().toString()); } KieContainer kContainer = ks.newKieContainer(kr.getDefaultReleaseId()); KieSession kSession = kContainer.newKieSession(); kSession.setGlobal(\"out\", out); kSession.insert(new Message(\"Dave\", \"Hello, HAL.

Build and Install - Maven mvn install This programmatically builds a KieModule. It populates the model that represents the ReleaseId and kmodule.xml, as well as add the relevant resources. A pom.xml is generated from the ReleaseId. Example 61.

Executable rule models are embedded models that provide a Java-based representation of a rule set for execution at build time. The executable model is a more efficient alternative to the standard asset packaging in previous versions of Drools and enables KIE containers and KIE bases to be created more quickly, especially when you have large lists of DRL (Drools Rule Language) files and other Drools assets. If you do not use the kie-maven-plugin plugin or if the required drools-model-compiler dependency is missing from your project, then rule assets are built without executable models. Therefore, to generate the executable model during build time, ensure that the kie-maven-plugin plugin and drools-model-compiler dependency are added in your project pom.xml file. Starting from Drools 8.33, if your project has drools-engine or drools-ruleunits-engine dependency, you don’t need to explicitly add drools-model-compiler to generate the executable model with kie-maven-plugin. Executable rule models provide the following specific advantages for your projects: Compile time: Traditionally, a packaged Drools project (KJAR) contains a list of DRL files and other Drools artifacts that define the rule base together with some pre-generated classes implementing the constraints and the consequences. Those DRL files must be parsed and compiled when the KJAR is downloaded from the Maven repository and installed in a KIE container. This process can be slow, especially for large rule sets. With an executable model, you can package within the project KJAR the Java classes that implement the executable model of the project rule base and re-create the KIE container and its KIE bases out of it in a much faster way. In Maven projects, you use the kie-maven-plugin plugin to automatically generate the executable model sources from the DRL files during the compilation process. Run time: In an executable model, all constraints are defined as Java lambda expressions. The same lambda expressions are also used for constraints evaluation, so you no longer need to use mvel expressions for interpreted evaluation nor the just-in-time (JIT) process to transform the mvel-based constraints into bytecode. This creates a quicker and more efficient run time. Development time: An executable model enables you to develop and experiment with new features of the Drools rule engine without needing to encode elements directly in the DRL format or modify the DRL parser to support them. For query definitions in executable rule models, you can use up to 10 arguments only. For variables within rule consequences in executable rule models, you can use up to 24 bound variables only (including the built-in drools variable). For example, the following rule consequence uses more than 24 bound variables and creates a compilation error: ... then $input.setNo25Count(functions.sumOf(new Object[]{$no1Count_1, $no2Count_1, $no3Count_1, ..., $no25Count_1}).intValue()); $input.getFirings().add(\"fired\"); update($input); Rule assets in Drools are built from executable rule models by default with the standard kie-maven-plugin plugin. The executable model is a more efficient alternative to the standard asset packaging in previous versions of Drools. However, if needed, you can modify or disable executable rule models to build a Drools project as a DRL-based KJAR instead of the default model-based KJAR. Procedure Build your Drools project in the usual way, but provide an alternate build option, depending on the type of project: For a Maven project, navigate to your Maven project directory in a command terminal and run the following command: mvn clean install -DgenerateModel= Replace with one of three values: YES_WITHDRL: (Default) Generates the executable model corresponding to the DRL files in the original project and also adds the DRL files to the generated KJAR for documentation purposes (the KIE base is built from the executable model regardless). YES: Generates the executable model corresponding to the DRL files in the original project and excludes the DRL files from the generated KJAR. NO: Does not generate the executable model. Example build command to disable the default executable model behavior: mvn clean install -DgenerateModel=NO For a Java application configured programmatically, the executable model is disabled by default. Add rule assets to the KIE virtual file system KieFileSystem and use KieBuilder with one of the following buildAll() methods: buildAll() (Default) or buildAll(DrlProject.class): Does not generate the executable model. buildAll(ExecutableModelProject.class): Generates the executable model corresponding to the DRL files in the original project. Example code to enable executable model behavior: import org.kie.api.KieServices; import org.kie.api.builder.KieFileSystem; import org.kie.api.builder.KieBuilder; KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieFileSystem kfs = ks.newKieFileSystem() kfs.write(\"src/main/resources/KBase1/ruleSet1.drl\", stringContainingAValidDRL) .write(\"src/main/resources/dtable.xls\", kieServices.getResources().newInputStreamResource(dtableFileStream)); KieBuilder kieBuilder = ks.newKieBuilder( kfs ); // Enable executable model kieBuilder.buildAll(ExecutableModelProject.class) assertEquals(0, kieBuilder.getResults().getMessages(Message.Level.ERROR).size()); Beginning in Drools 7.39, rule assets are built from executable rule models by default with the standard kie-maven-plugin plugin. The executable model is a more efficient alternative to the standard asset packaging in previous versions of Drools. When you install Drools 7.39, this default executable model behavior is configured for all new projects that you create going forward. However, if you are upgrading to Drools 7.39 from a previous version of the product and you have not already enabled executable rule models, you must add the required dependency to your existing Drools projects so that your rule assets are built from executable models in Drools 7.39. If you do not use the kie-maven-plugin plugin or if the required drools-model-compiler dependency is missing from your project, then rule assets are built without executable models. For more information about executable rule models, see Executable rule models. Procedure In the pom.xml file of your Maven project or on the relevant class path of your Java project, add the following dependency to enable rule assets to be built from the default executable model: org.drools drools-model-compiler ${drools.version} This dependency compiles the executable model into Drools internal data structures so that it can be executed by the Drools rule engine. The is the Maven artifact version for Drools currently used in your project (for example, 10.0.0.Final). Previous sections in this chapter explained traditional KIE APIs to use Drools rule engine. However, as introduced in First Rule Project, Rule Unit is a new and recommended style for implementing rules since Drools 8. A rule unit is an atomic module defining a set of rules and a set of strongly typed data sources through which the facts processed by the rules are inserted. The data sources of 2 kinds: DataStream and DataStore which will be described later in this section. DataSources can be shared across different units, providing a coordination mechanism between them. RuleUnitData is an interface to define your Rule Unit. Rule unit implementation would be like this: public class MeasurementUnit implements RuleUnitData { private final DataStore measurements; private final Set controlSet = new HashSet<>(); public MeasurementUnit() { this(DataSource.createStore()); } public MeasurementUnit(DataStore measurements) { this.measurements = measurements; } public DataStore getMeasurements() { return measurements; } public Set getControlSet() { return controlSet; } } In this case, Measurement is your fact class, so you need to implement it as well. The name of the rule unit class MeasurementUnit is linked to DRL rules using the unit statement. package org.example; unit MeasurementUnit; rule \"will execute per each Measurement having ID color\" when .... Data sources are typed sources of data that rule units can subscribe to for updates. You interact with the rule unit through the data sources it exposes. Drools supports the following types of data sources. DataStream: An append-only storage option. Use this storage option when you want to publish or share data values. You can use the notation DataSource.createStream() to return a DataStream object and use the method append(T) to add more data. Example DataStream data source usage DataStream measurements = DataSource.createStream(); // Append value and notify all subscribers measurements.append(new Measurement(\"color\", \"red\")); DataStore: A writable storage option for adding or removing data and then notifying all subscribers that mutable data has been modified. Rules can pattern-match against incoming values and update or remove available values. For users familiar with traditional DRL syntax, this option is equivalent to a typed version of an entry point. In fact, a DataStore is equivalent to a traditional-style entry point. Example DataStore data source usage DataStore measurements = DataSource.createStore(); Measurement measurement = new Measurement(\"color\", \"red\"); // Add value and notify all subscribers DataHandle mHandle = measurements.add(measurement); measure.setValue(\"blue\"); // Notify all subscribers that the value referenced by `mHandle` has changed measurements.update(mHandle, measurement); // Remove value referenced by `mHandle` and notify all subscribers measurements.remove(mHandle); SingletonStore: A writable storage option for setting or clearing a single element and then notifying all subscribers that the element has been modified. Rules can pattern-match against the value and update or clear available values. For users familiar with traditional DRL syntax, this option is similar to a global but reactive to changes. A Singleton is similar to a traditional-style global, except that when used in conjunction with rules, you can pattern-match against it. Example SingletonStore data source definition SingletonStore measurement = DataSource.createSingleton(); Measurement m1 = new Measurement(\"color\", \"red\"); // Add value `m1` and notify all subscribers measurement.set(m1); measure.setValue(\"blue\"); // Notify all subscribers that the value has changed measurement.update(); Measurement m2 = new Measurement(\"color\", \"green\"); // Overwrite contained value with `m2` and notify all subscribers measurement.set(m2); measure2.setValue(\"black\"); // Notify all subscribers that the value has changed measurement.update(); // Clear store and notify all subscribers measurement.clear(); Subscribers to a data source are known as data processors. A data processor implements the DataProcessor interface. This interface contains callbacks to all the events that a subscribed data source can trigger. DataProcessor public interface DataProcessor { default void insert(T object) { insert(null, object); } FactHandle insert(DataHandle handle, T object); void update(DataHandle handle, T object); void delete(DataHandle handle); } The DataHandle is an internal reference to an object of a data source. Each callback method might or might not be invoked, depending on whether the corresponding data source implements the capability. For example, a DataStream source invokes only the insert callback, whereas a SingletonStore source invokes the insert callback on set and the delete callback on clear or before an overwriting set. Note that DataProcessor is a little internal detail. If you instantiate RuleUnitInstance, EntryPointDataProcessor is automatically bound to the rule unit’s data sources. Finally, you instantiate a RuleUnitInstance using RuleUnitProvider to execute the rules. public void test() { MeasurementUnit measurementUnit = new MeasurementUnit(); try (RuleUnitInstance instance = RuleUnitProvider.get().createRuleUnitInstance(measurementUnit)) { measurementUnit.getMeasurements().add(new Measurement(\"color\", \"red\")); ... List queryResult = instance.executeQuery(\"FindColor\").stream().map(tuple -> (Measurement) tuple.get(\"$m\")).collect(toList()); ... } // instance.close() is called automatically } You can add configurations by creating RuleUnitInstance with RuleConfig. Configuring event listeners RuleConfig ruleConfig = RuleUnitProvider.get().newRuleConfig(); ruleConfig.getAgendaEventListeners().add(new MyAgendaEventListener()); ruleConfig.getRuleRuntimeListeners().add(new MyRuleRuntimeEventListener()); ruleConfig.getRuleEventListeners().add(new MyRuleEventListener()); HelloWorldUnit unit = new HelloWorldUnit(); RuleUnitInstance unitInstance = RuleUnitProvider.get().createRuleUnitInstance(unit, ruleConfig); Instead of writing a Java class, you can declare rule units directly in DRL. See Rule units in DRL. In addition to the standard Rule Unit API, Drools offers an alternative way of writing rules in combination with Rule Unit. You can now define the rules for Rule Units using a dedicated set of Java APIs. As an end-user, you can think of the Rule Unit DSL as an alternative to DRL, in order to define your rules with an internal DSL using Java. This can be helpful if you are authoring rules as a Drools end-user, but you are also proficient with Java: in that case, you now can define rules with DRL or Rule Unit DSL. The Rule Unit DSL is not intended to be used a way to code-generate executable model code, nor to produce DRL files. The goal of the Rule Unit DSL is to programmatically invoke the exec model methods (at runtime). As a developer using Drools for your application development (you do not write the rules yourself, you write the Java code to integrate Drools in your app development for your end-users) you may find helpful to leverage programmatically the Rule Unit DSL only for very dynamic use-cases, that is when the rule is only known at runtime, and compile-time performance optimizations are not needed. Let’s learn with comments on the example. public class HelloWorldUnit implements RuleUnitDefinition { private final DataStore strings; // DataStore where you add String fact private final DataStore ints; // DataStore where you add Integer fact private final List results = new ArrayList<>(); // Store results. In traditional DRL, it is called `global` // omitting constructors and getters // ... @Override public void defineRules(RulesFactory rulesFactory) { // /strings[ this == \"Hello World\" ] rulesFactory.rule() .on(strings) .filter(EQUAL, \"Hello World\") // when no extractor is provided \"this\" is implicit .execute(results, r -> r.add(\"it worked!\")); // the consequence can ignore the matched facts // /strings[ length > 5 ] rulesFactory.rule() .on(strings) // since the datasource has been already initialized its class can be inferred without the need of explicitly passing it .filter(s -> s.length(), GREATER_THAN, 5) // when no property name is provided it's impossible to generate indexes and property reactivity .execute(results, (r, s) -> r.add(\"it also worked with \" + s.toUpperCase())); // this consequence also uses the matched fact // /strings[ length s.length(), LESS_THAN, 5) // providing the name of the property used in the constraint allows index and property reactivity generation .execute(results, r -> r.add(\"this shouldn't fire\")); // $s: /strings[ length > 5 ] // /ints[ this > 5, this == $s.length ] rulesFactory.rule() .on(strings) .filter(\"length\", s -> s.length() > 5) // it is also possible to use a plain lambda predicate, but in this case no index can be generated .join( rule -> rule.on(ints) // creates a new pattern ... .filter(GREATER_THAN, 5) // ... add an alpha filter to it ) // ... and join it with the former one .filter(EQUAL, String::length) // this filter is applied to the result of the join, so it is a beta constraint .execute(results, (r, s, i) -> r.add(\"String '\" + s + \"' is \" + i + \" characters long\")); // the consequence captures all the joined variables positionally } } As you define rules using defineRules method, you can execute the rules, of course, without having to define them using DRL. public void helloWorld() { HelloWorldUnit unit = new HelloWorldUnit(); unit.getStrings().add(\"Hello World\"); RuleUnitInstance unitInstance = RuleUnitProvider.get().createRuleUnitInstance(unit); assertThat(unitInstance.fire()).isEqualTo(2); assertThat(unit.getResults()).containsExactlyInAnyOrder(\"it worked!\", \"it also worked with HELLO WORLD\"); unit.getResults().clear(); unit.getInts().add(11); assertThat(unitInstance.fire()).isEqualTo(1); assertThat(unit.getResults()).containsExactly(\"String 'Hello World' is 11 characters long\"); unitInstance.close(); } You can find various test cases under https://github.com/kiegroup/drools/tree/main/drools-ruleunits/drools-ruleunits-dsl The KIE scanner in Drools monitors your Maven repository for new SNAPSHOT versions of your Drools project and then deploys the latest version of the project to a specified KIE container. You can use a KIE scanner in a development environment to maintain your Drools project deployments more efficiently as new versions become available. For production environments, do not use a KIE scanner with SNAPSHOT project versions to avoid accidental or unexpected project updates. The KIE scanner is intended for development environments that use SNAPSHOT project versions. Prerequisites The kie-ci.jar file is available on the class path of your Drools project. Procedure In the relevant .java class in your project, register and start the KIE scanner as shown in the following example code: Registering and starting a KIE scanner for a KIE container import org.kie.api.KieServices; import org.kie.api.builder.ReleaseId; import org.kie.api.runtime.KieContainer; import org.kie.api.builder.KieScanner; ... KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get(); ReleaseId releaseId = kieServices .newReleaseId(\"com.sample\", \"my-app\", \"1.0-SNAPSHOT\"); KieContainer kContainer = kieServices.newKieContainer(releaseId); KieScanner kScanner = kieServices.newKieScanner(kContainer); // Start KIE scanner for polling the Maven repository every 10 seconds (10000 ms) kScanner.start(10000L); In this example, the KIE scanner is configured to run with a fixed time interval. The minimum KIE scanner polling interval is 1 millisecond (ms) and the maximum polling interval is the maximum value of the data type long. A polling interval of 0 or less results in a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: pollingInterval must be positive error. You can also configure the KIE scanner to run on demand by invoking the scanNow() method. The project group ID, artifact ID, and version (GAV) settings in the example are defined as com.sample:my-app:1.0-SNAPSHOT. The project version must contain the -SNAPSHOT suffix to enable the KIE scanner to retrieve the latest build of the specified artifact version. If you change the snapshot project version number, such as increasing to 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT, then you must also update the version in the GAV definition in your KIE scanner configuration. The KIE scanner does not retrieve updates for projects with static versions, such as com.sample:my-app:1.0. In the settings.xml file of your Maven repository, set the updatePolicy configuration to always to enable the KIE scanner to function properly: my-nexus-env my-nexus My Nexus repository http://repository.example.org/nexus/content/groups/public/ default true always true always After the KIE scanner starts polling, if the KIE scanner detects an updated version of the SNAPSHOT project in the specified KIE container, the KIE scanner automatically downloads the new project version and triggers an incremental build of the new project. From that moment, all of the new KieBase and KieSession objects that were created from the KIE container use the new project version. Starting with JDK17, the Java Platform has deprecated the Security Manager for removal; consequently, this Drools feature may become unsupported in the future. For more information: https://openjdk.org/jeps/411 The KIE engine is a platform for the modelling and execution of business behavior, using a multitude of declarative abstractions and metaphors, like rules, processes, decision tables and etc. Many times, the authoring of these metaphors is done by third party groups, be it a different group inside the same company, a group from a partner company, or even anonymous third parties on the internet. Rules and Processes are designed to execute arbitrary code in order to do their job, but in such cases it might be necessary to constrain what they can do. For instance, it is unlikely a rule should be allowed to create a classloader (what could open the system to an attack) and certainly it should not be allowed to make a call to System.exit(). The Java Platform provides a very comprehensive and well defined security framework that allows users to define policies for what a system can do. The KIE platform leverages that framework and allow application developers to define a specific policy to be applied to any execution of user provided code, be it in rules, processes, work item handlers and etc. Rules and processes can run with very restrict permissions, but the engine itself needs to perform many complex operations in order to work. Examples are: it needs to create classloaders, read system properties, access the file system, etc. Once a security manager is installed, though, it will apply restrictions to all the code executing in the JVM according to the defined policy. For that reason, KIE allows the user to define two different policy files: one for the engine itself and one for the assets deployed into and executed by the engine. One easy way to setup the environment is to give the engine itself a very permissive policy, while providing a constrained policy for rules and processes. Policy files follow the standard policy file syntax as described in the Java documentation. For more details, see: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/PolicyFiles.html#FileSyntax A permissive policy file for the engine can look like the following: Example 62. A sample engine.policy file grant { permission java.security.AllPermission; } An example security policy for rules could be: Example 63. A sample rules.policy file grant { permission java.util.PropertyPermission \"*\", \"read\"; permission java.lang.RuntimePermission \"accessDeclaredMembers\"; } Please note that depending on what the rules and processes are supposed to do, many more permissions might need to be granted, like accessing files in the filesystem, databases, etc. In order to use these policy files, all that is necessary is to execute the application with these files as parameters to the JVM. Three parameters are required: Table 3. Parameters Parameter Meaning -Djava.security.manager Enables the security manager -Djava.security.policy= Defines the global policy file to be applied to the whole application, including the engine -Dkie.security.policy= Defines the policy file to be applied to rules and processes For instance: java -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=global.policy -Dkie.security.policy=rules.policy foo.bar.MyApp When executing the engine inside a container, use your container’s documentation to find out how to configure the Security Manager and how to define the global security policy. Define the kie security policy as described above and set the kie.security.policy system property in order to configure the engine to use it. Please note that unless a Security Manager is configured, the kie.security.policy will be ignored. A Security Manager has a high performance impact in the JVM. Applications with strict performance requirements are strongly discouraged of using a Security Manager. An alternative is the use of other security procedures like the auditing of rules/processes before testing and deployment to prevent malicious code from being deployed to the environment.","title":"Build, Deploy, Utilize and Run","component":"drools","version":"","name":"index","url":"/drools/KIE/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_kiemoduleintroductionbuildingintroductionsection","id":1},{"text":"Building","hash":"_kiebuildingsection","id":2},{"text":"Creating and building a Kie Project","hash":"_creatingandbuildingakieproject","id":3},{"text":"The kmodule.xml file","hash":"_thekmodulexmlfile","id":4},{"text":"Building with Maven","hash":"_buildingwithmaven","id":5},{"text":"Engine dependency","hash":"_enginedependency","id":6},{"text":"Building with Maven and running Drools in a uber-jar or fat jar","hash":"_buildingwithmavenandrunningdroolsinauberjarorfatjar","id":7},{"text":"Defining a KieModule programmatically","hash":"_definingakiemoduleprogrammatically","id":8},{"text":"Changing the Default Build Result Severity","hash":"_changingthedefaultbuildresultseverity","id":9},{"text":"Deploying","hash":"_kiedeployingsection","id":10},{"text":"KieBase","hash":"_kiebase","id":11},{"text":"KieSessions and KieBase Modifications","hash":"_kiesessions_and_kiebase_modifications","id":12},{"text":"KieScanner","hash":"_kiescanner","id":13},{"text":"Maven Versions and Dependencies","hash":"_maven_versions_and_dependencies","id":14},{"text":"Settings.xml and Remote Repository Setup","hash":"_settings_xml_and_remote_repository_setup","id":15},{"text":"Running","hash":"_kierunningsection","id":16},{"text":"KieBase","hash":"_kiebase_2","id":17},{"text":"KieSession","hash":"_kiesession","id":18},{"text":"KieRuntime","hash":"_kieruntime","id":19},{"text":"KieRuntime","hash":"_kieruntime_2","id":20},{"text":"Globals","hash":"_globals","id":21},{"text":"Event Model","hash":"_event_model","id":22},{"text":"KieRuntimeLogger","hash":"_kieruntimelogger","id":23},{"text":"Commands and the CommandExecutor","hash":"_commands_and_the_commandexecutor","id":24},{"text":"StatelessKieSession","hash":"_statelesskiesession","id":25},{"text":"Marshalling","hash":"_marshalling","id":26},{"text":"Persistence and Transactions","hash":"_persistence_and_transactions","id":27},{"text":"Build, Deploy and Utilize Examples","hash":"_kieexamplessection","id":28},{"text":"Default KieSession","hash":"_default_kiesession","id":29},{"text":"Named KieSession","hash":"_named_kiesession","id":30},{"text":"KieBase Inheritance","hash":"_kiebase_inheritance","id":31},{"text":"Multiple KieBases","hash":"_multiple_kiebases","id":32},{"text":"KieContainer from KieRepository","hash":"_kiecontainer_from_kierepository","id":33},{"text":"Default KieSession from File","hash":"_default_kiesession_from_file","id":34},{"text":"Named KieSession from File","hash":"_named_kiesession_from_file","id":35},{"text":"KieModule with Dependent KieModule","hash":"_kiemodule_with_dependent_kiemodule","id":36},{"text":"Programmatically build a Simple KieModule with Defaults","hash":"_programmatically_build_a_simple_kiemodule_with_defaults","id":37},{"text":"Programmatically build a KieModule using Meta Models","hash":"_programmatically_build_a_kiemodule_using_meta_models","id":38},{"text":"Executable rule models","hash":"executable-model-con_packaging-deploying","id":39},{"text":"Modifying or disabling executable rule models in a Drools project","hash":"executable-model-modify-proc_packaging-deploying","id":40},{"text":"Enabling executable rule models when upgrading to Drools 7.39","hash":"executable-model-upgrading-proc_packaging-deploying","id":41},{"text":"Rule Unit API","hash":"rule-unit-api_packaging-deploying","id":42},{"text":"RuleUnitData","hash":"_ruleunitdata","id":43},{"text":"Data sources","hash":"_data_sources","id":44},{"text":"Client code","hash":"_client_code","id":45},{"text":"Configurations","hash":"_configurations","id":46},{"text":"Declare rule units in DRL","hash":"_declare_rule_units_in_drl","id":47},{"text":"Rule Unit DSL","hash":"rule-unit-dsl_packaging-deploying","id":48},{"text":"Using a KIE scanner to monitor and update KIE containers","hash":"kie-scanner-proc_packaging-deploying","id":49},{"text":"Security Manager","hash":"_securitymanager","id":50},{"text":"How to define a KIE Policy","hash":"_howtodefinekiepolicy","id":51}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"Decision Model and Notation (DMN) is a standard established by the Object Management Group (OMG) for describing and modeling operational decisions. DMN defines an XML schema that enables DMN models to be shared between DMN-compliant platforms and across organizations so that business analysts and business rules developers can collaborate in designing and implementing DMN decision services. The DMN standard is similar to and can be used together with the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard for designing and modeling business processes. For general information about the background and applications of DMN, see the Drools DMN landing page. The DMN specification defines three incremental levels of conformance in a software implementation. A product that claims compliance at one level must also be compliant with any preceding levels. For example, a conformance level 3 implementation must also include the supported components in conformance levels 1 and 2. For the formal definitions of each conformance level, see the OMG Decision Model and Notation specification. The following list summarizes the three DMN conformance levels: Conformance level 1 A DMN conformance level 1 implementation supports decision requirement diagrams (DRDs), decision logic, and decision tables, but decision models are not executable. Any language can be used to define the expressions, including natural, unstructured languages. Conformance level 2 A DMN conformance level 2 implementation includes the requirements in conformance level 1, and supports Simplified Friendly Enough Expression Language (S-FEEL) expressions and fully executable decision models. Conformance level 3 A DMN conformance level 3 implementation includes the requirements in conformance levels 1 and 2, and supports Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) expressions, the full set of boxed expressions, and fully executable decision models. Drools DMN engine provides runtime support for DMN 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 models at conformance level 3. KIE DMN Editor provides design support for DMN 1.2 models at conformance level 3. You can design your DMN models directly with KIE DMN Editor online, directly with KIE DMN Editor in VSCode, or import existing DMN models into your Drools projects for deployment and execution. Any DMN 1.1 and 1.3 models (do not contain DMN 1.3 features) that you import or open into KIE DMN Editor and save are converted to DMN 1.2 models. A decision requirements diagram (DRD) is a visual representation of your DMN model. A DRD can represent part or all of the overall decision requirements graph (DRG) for the DMN model. DRDs trace business decisions using decision nodes, business knowledge models, sources of business knowledge, input data, and decision services. The following table summarizes the components in a DRD: Table 1. DRD components Component Description Notation Elements Decision Node where one or more input elements determine an output based on defined decision logic. Business knowledge model Reusable function with one or more decision elements. Decisions that have the same logic but depend on different sub-input data or sub-decisions use business knowledge models to determine which procedure to follow. Knowledge source External authorities, documents, committees, or policies that regulate a decision or business knowledge model. Knowledge sources are references to real-world factors rather than executable business rules. Input data Information used in a decision node or a business knowledge model. Input data usually includes business-level concepts or objects relevant to the business, such as loan applicant data used in a lending strategy. Decision service Top-level decision containing a set of reusable decisions published as a service for invocation. A decision service can be invoked from an external application or a BPMN business process. Requirement connectors Information requirement Connection from an input data node or decision node to another decision node that requires the information. Knowledge requirement Connection from a business knowledge model to a decision node or to another business knowledge model that invokes the decision logic. Authority requirement Connection from an input data node or a decision node to a dependent knowledge source or from a knowledge source to a decision node, business knowledge model, or another knowledge source. Artifacts Text annotation Explanatory note associated with an input data node, decision node, business knowledge model, or knowledge source. Association Connection from an input data node, decision node, business knowledge model, or knowledge source to a text annotation. The following table summarizes the permitted connectors between DRD elements: Table 2. DRD connector rules Starts from Connects to Connection type Example Decision Decision Information requirement Business knowledge model Decision Knowledge requirement Business knowledge model Decision service Decision Knowledge requirement Business knowledge model Input data Decision Information requirement Knowledge source Authority requirement Knowledge source Decision Authority requirement Business knowledge model Knowledge source Decision Text annotation Association Business knowledge model Knowledge source Input data The following example DRD illustrates some of these DMN components in practice: Figure 1. Example DRD: Loan prequalification The following example DRD illustrates DMN components that are part of a reusable decision service: Figure 2. Example DRD: Phone call handling as a decision service In a DMN decision service node, the decision nodes in the bottom segment incorporate input data from outside of the decision service to arrive at a final decision in the top segment of the decision service node. The resulting top-level decisions from the decision service are then implemented in any subsequent decisions or business knowledge requirements of the DMN model. You can reuse DMN decision services in other DMN models to apply the same decision logic with different input data and different outgoing connections. Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) is an expression language defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) DMN specification. FEEL expressions define the logic of a decision in a DMN model. FEEL is designed to facilitate both decision modeling and execution by assigning semantics to the decision model constructs. FEEL expressions in decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) occupy table cells in boxed expressions for decision nodes and business knowledge models. The following sections provide just some highlights about some of the FEEL features. For complete information about FEEL, and built-in FEEL functions in DMN, you can reference the Drools DMN engine, DMN FEEL handbook. Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) supports the following data types: Numbers Strings Boolean values Dates Time Date and time Days and time duration Years and months duration Functions Contexts Ranges (or intervals) Lists The DMN specification currently does not provide an explicit way of declaring a variable as a function, context, range, or list, but Drools extends the DMN built-in types to support variables of these types. The following list describes each data type: Numbers Numbers in FEEL are based on the IEEE 754-2008 Decimal 128 format, with 34 digits of precision. Internally, numbers are represented in Java as BigDecimals with MathContext DECIMAL128. FEEL supports only one number data type, so the same type is used to represent both integers and floating point numbers. FEEL numbers use a dot (.) as a decimal separator. FEEL does not support -INF, +INF, or NaN. FEEL uses null to represent invalid numbers. Drools extends the DMN specification and supports additional number notations: Scientific: You can use scientific notation with the suffix e or E. For example, 1.2e3 is the same as writing the expression 1.2*10**3, but is a literal instead of an expression. Hexadecimal: You can use hexadecimal numbers with the prefix 0x. For example, 0xff is the same as the decimal number 255. Both uppercase and lowercase letters are supported. For example, 0XFF is the same as 0xff. Type suffixes: You can use the type suffixes f, F, d, D, l, and L. These suffixes are ignored. Strings Strings in FEEL are any sequence of characters delimited by double quotation marks. Example \"John Doe\" Boolean values FEEL uses three-valued boolean logic, so a boolean logic expression may have values true, false, or null. Dates Date literals are not supported in FEEL, but you can use the built-in date() function to construct date values. Date strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes document. The format is \"YYYY-MM-DD\" where YYYY is the year with four digits, MM is the number of the month with two digits, and DD is the number of the day. Example: date( \"2017-06-23\" ) Date objects have time equal to \"00:00:00\", which is midnight. The dates are considered to be local, without a timezone. Time Time literals are not supported in FEEL, but you can use the built-in time() function to construct time values. Time strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes document. The format is \"hh:mm:ss[.uuu][(+-)hh:mm]\" where hh is the hour of the day (from 00 to 23), mm is the minutes in the hour, and ss is the number of seconds in the minute. Optionally, the string may define the number of milliseconds (uuu) within the second and contain a positive (+) or negative (-) offset from UTC time to define its timezone. Instead of using an offset, you can use the letter z to represent the UTC time, which is the same as an offset of -00:00. If no offset is defined, the time is considered to be local. Examples: time( \"04:25:12\" ) time( \"14:10:00+02:00\" ) time( \"22:35:40.345-05:00\" ) time( \"15:00:30z\" ) Time values that define an offset or a timezone cannot be compared to local times that do not define an offset or a timezone. Date and time Date and time literals are not supported in FEEL, but you can use the built-in date and time() function to construct date and time values. Date and time strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes document. The format is \"T\", where and follow the prescribed XML schema formatting, conjoined by T. Examples: date and time( \"2017-10-22T23:59:00\" ) date and time( \"2017-06-13T14:10:00+02:00\" ) date and time( \"2017-02-05T22:35:40.345-05:00\" ) date and time( \"2017-06-13T15:00:30z\" ) Date and time values that define an offset or a timezone cannot be compared to local date and time values that do not define an offset or a timezone. If your implementation of the DMN specification does not support spaces in the XML schema, use the keyword dateTime as a synonym of date and time. Days and time duration Days and time duration literals are not supported in FEEL, but you can use the built-in duration() function to construct days and time duration values. Days and time duration strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes document, but are restricted to only days, hours, minutes and seconds. Months and years are not supported. Examples: duration( \"P1DT23H12M30S\" ) duration( \"P23D\" ) duration( \"PT12H\" ) duration( \"PT35M\" ) If your implementation of the DMN specification does not support spaces in the XML schema, use the keyword dayTimeDuration as a synonym of days and time duration. Years and months duration Years and months duration literals are not supported in FEEL, but you can use the built-in duration() function to construct days and time duration values. Years and months duration strings in FEEL follow the format defined in the XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes document, but are restricted to only years and months. Days, hours, minutes, or seconds are not supported. Examples: duration( \"P3Y5M\" ) duration( \"P2Y\" ) duration( \"P10M\" ) duration( \"P25M\" ) If your implementation of the DMN specification does not support spaces in the XML schema, use the keyword yearMonthDuration as a synonym of years and months duration. Functions FEEL has function literals (or anonymous functions) that you can use to create functions. The DMN specification currently does not provide an explicit way of declaring a variable as a function, but Drools extends the DMN built-in types to support variables of functions. Example: function(a, b) a + b In this example, the FEEL expression creates a function that adds the parameters a and b and returns the result. Contexts FEEL has context literals that you can use to create contexts. A context in FEEL is a list of key and value pairs, similar to maps in languages like Java. The DMN specification currently does not provide an explicit way of declaring a variable as a context, but Drools extends the DMN built-in types to support variables of contexts. Example: { x : 5, y : 3 } In this example, the expression creates a context with two entries, x and y, representing a coordinate in a chart. In DMN 1.2, another way to create contexts is to create an item definition that contains the list of keys as attributes, and then declare the variable as having that item definition type. The Drools DMN API supports DMN ItemDefinition structural types in a DMNContext represented in two ways: User-defined Java type: Must be a valid JavaBeans object defining properties and getters for each of the components in the DMN ItemDefinition. If necessary, you can also use the @FEELProperty annotation for those getters representing a component name which would result in an invalid Java identifier. java.util.Map interface: The map needs to define the appropriate entries, with the keys corresponding to the component name in the DMN ItemDefinition. Ranges (or intervals) FEEL has range literals that you can use to create ranges or intervals. A range in FEEL is a value that defines a lower and an upper bound, where either can be open or closed. The DMN specification currently does not provide an explicit way of declaring a variable as a range, but Drools extends the DMN built-in types to support variables of ranges. The syntax of a range is defined in the following formats: range := interval_start endpoint '..' endpoint interval_end interval_start := open_start | closed_start open_start := '(' | ']' closed_start := '[' interval_end := open_end | closed_end open_end := ')' | '[' closed_end := ']' endpoint := expression The expression for the endpoint must return a comparable value, and the lower bound endpoint must be lower than the upper bound endpoint. For example, the following literal expression defines an interval between 1 and 10, including the boundaries (a closed interval on both endpoints): [ 1 .. 10 ] The following literal expression defines an interval between 1 hour and 12 hours, including the lower boundary (a closed interval), but excluding the upper boundary (an open interval): [ duration(\"PT1H\") .. duration(\"PT12H\") ) You can use ranges in decision tables to test for ranges of values, or use ranges in simple literal expressions. For example, the following literal expression returns true if the value of a variable x is between 0 and 100: x in [ 1 .. 100 ] Lists FEEL has list literals that you can use to create lists of items. A list in FEEL is represented by a comma-separated list of values enclosed in square brackets. The DMN specification currently does not provide an explicit way of declaring a variable as a list, but Drools extends the DMN built-in types to support variables of lists. Example: [ 2, 3, 4, 5 ] All lists in FEEL contain elements of the same type and are immutable. Elements in a list can be accessed by index, where the first element is 1. Negative indexes can access elements starting from the end of the list so that -1 is the last element. For example, the following expression returns the second element of a list x: x[2] The following expression returns the second-to-last element of a list x: x[-2] Elements in a list can also be counted by the function count, which uses the list of elements as the parameter. For example, the following expression returns 4: count([ 2, 3, 4, 5 ]) To promote interoperability with other platforms and systems, Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) includes a library of built-in functions. The built-in FEEL functions are implemented in the Drools Decision Model and Notation (DMN) engine so that you can use the functions in your DMN decision services. For detailed information about FEEL and built-in FEEL functions in DMN, you can reference the Drools DMN engine, DMN FEEL handbook. Unlike many traditional expression languages, Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) supports spaces and a few special characters as part of variable and function names. A FEEL name must start with a letter, ?, or _ element. The unicode letter characters are also allowed. Variable names cannot start with a language keyword, such as and, true, or every. The remaining characters in a variable name can be any of the starting characters, as well as digits, white spaces, and special characters such as +, -, /, *, ', and .. For example, the following names are all valid FEEL names: Age Birth Date Flight 234 pre-check procedure Several limitations apply to variable and function names in FEEL: Ambiguity The use of spaces, keywords, and other special characters as part of names can make FEEL ambiguous. The ambiguities are resolved in the context of the expression, matching names from left to right. The parser resolves the variable name as the longest name matched in scope. You can use ( ) to disambiguate names if necessary. Spaces in names The DMN specification limits the use of spaces in FEEL names. According to the DMN specification, names can contain multiple spaces but not two consecutive spaces. In order to make the language easier to use and avoid common errors due to spaces, Drools removes the limitation on the use of consecutive spaces. Drools supports variable names with any number of consecutive spaces, but normalizes them into a single space. For example, the variable references First Name with one space and First Name with two spaces are both acceptable in Drools. Drools also normalizes the use of other white spaces, like the non-breakable white space that is common in web pages, tabs, and line breaks. From a Drools FEEL engine perspective, all of these characters are normalized into a single white space before processing. The keyword in The keyword in is the only keyword in the language that cannot be used as part of a variable name. Although the specifications allow the use of keywords in the middle of variable names, the use of in in variable names conflicts with the grammar definition of for, every and some expression constructs. Boxed expressions in DMN are tables that you use to define the underlying logic of decision nodes and business knowledge models in a decision requirements diagram (DRD). Some boxed expressions can contain other boxed expressions, but the top-level boxed expression corresponds to the decision logic of a single DRD artifact. While DRDs represent the flow of a DMN decision model, boxed expressions define the actual decision logic of individual nodes. DRDs and boxed expressions together form a complete and functional DMN decision model. The following are the types of DMN boxed expressions: Decision tables Literal expressions Contexts Relations Functions Invocations Lists KIE DMN Editor does not provide boxed list expressions, but supports a FEEL list data type that you can use in boxed literal expressions. For more information about the list data type and other FEEL data types in Drools, see Data types in FEEL. All Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) expressions that you use in your boxed expressions must conform to the FEEL syntax requirements in the OMG Decision Model and Notation specification. A decision table in DMN is a visual representation of one or more business rules in a tabular format. You use decision tables to define rules for a decision node that applies those rules at a given point in the decision model. Each rule consists of a single row in the table, and includes columns that define the conditions (input) and outcome (output) for that particular row. The definition of each row is precise enough to derive the outcome using the values of the conditions. Input and output values can be FEEL expressions or defined data type values. For example, the following decision table determines credit score ratings based on a defined range of a loan applicant’s credit score: Figure 3. Decision table for credit score rating The following decision table determines the next step in a lending strategy for applicants depending on applicant loan eligibility and the bureau call type: Figure 4. Decision table for lending strategy The following decision table determines applicant qualification for a loan as the concluding decision node in a loan prequalification decision model: Figure 5. Decision table for loan prequalification Decision tables are a popular way of modeling rules and decision logic, and are used in many methodologies (such as DMN) and implementation frameworks (such as Drools). Drools supports both DMN decision tables and Drools-native decision tables, but they are different types of assets with different syntax requirements and are not interchangeable. For more information about Drools-native decision tables in Drools, see Spreadsheet decision tables. Hit policies determine how to reach an outcome when multiple rules in a decision table match the provided input values. For example, if one rule in a decision table applies a sales discount to military personnel and another rule applies a discount to students, then when a customer is both a student and in the military, the decision table hit policy must indicate whether to apply one discount or the other (Unique, First) or both discounts (Collect Sum). You specify the single character of the hit policy (U, F, C+) in the upper-left corner of the decision table. The following decision table hit policies are supported in DMN: Unique (U): Permits only one rule to match. Any overlap raises an error. Any (A): Permits multiple rules to match, but they must all have the same output. If multiple matching rules do not have the same output, an error is raised. Priority (P): Permits multiple rules to match, with different outputs. The output that comes first in the output values list is selected. First (F): Uses the first match in rule order. Collect (C+, C>, C): Outputs the maximum value among the matches. The resulting values must be comparable, such as numbers, dates or text (lexicographic order). Collect Count (C#): Outputs the number of matching rules. A boxed literal expression in DMN is a literal FEEL expression as text in a table cell, typically with a labeled column and an assigned data type. You use boxed literal expressions to define simple or complex node logic or decision data directly in FEEL for a particular node in a decision. Literal FEEL expressions must conform to FEEL syntax requirements in the OMG Decision Model and Notation specification. For example, the following boxed literal expression defines the minimum acceptable PITI calculation (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) in a lending decision, where acceptable rate is a variable defined in the DMN model: Figure 6. Boxed literal expression for minimum PITI value The following boxed literal expression sorts a list of possible dating candidates (soul mates) in an online dating application based on their score on criteria such as age, location, and interests: Figure 7. Boxed literal expression for matching online dating candidates A boxed context expression in DMN is a set of variable names and values with a result value. Each name-value pair is a context entry. You use context expressions to represent data definitions in decision logic and set a value for a desired decision element within the DMN decision model. A value in a boxed context expression can be a data type value or FEEL expression, or can contain a nested sub-expression of any type, such as a decision table, a literal expression, or another context expression. For example, the following boxed context expression defines the factors for sorting delayed passengers in a flight-rebooking decision model, based on defined data types (tPassengerTable, tFlightNumberList): Figure 8. Boxed context expression for flight passenger waiting list The following boxed context expression defines the factors that determine whether a loan applicant can meet minimum mortgage payments based on principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI), represented as a front-end ratio calculation with a sub-context expression: Figure 9. Boxed context expression for front-end client PITI ratio A boxed relation expression in DMN is a traditional data table with information about given entities, listed as rows. You use boxed relation tables to define decision data for relevant entities in a decision at a particular node. Boxed relation expressions are similar to context expressions in that they set variable names and values, but relation expressions contain no result value and list all variable values based on a single defined variable in each column. For example, the following boxed relation expression provides information about employees in an employee rostering decision: Figure 10. Boxed relation expression with employee information A boxed function expression in DMN is a parameterized boxed expression containing a literal FEEL expression, a nested context expression of an external JAVA or PMML function, or a nested boxed expression of any type. By default, all business knowledge models are defined as boxed function expressions. You use boxed function expressions to call functions on your decision logic and to define all business knowledge models. For example, the following boxed function expression determines airline flight capacity in a flight-rebooking decision model: Figure 11. Boxed function expression for flight capacity The following boxed function expression contains a basic Java function as a context expression for determining absolute value in a decision model calculation: Figure 12. Boxed function expression for absolute value The following boxed function expression determines a monthly mortgage installment as a business knowledge model in a lending decision, with the function value defined as a nested context expression: Figure 13. Boxed function expression for installment calculation in business knowledge model The following boxed function expression uses a PMML model included in the DMN file to define the minimum acceptable PITI calculation (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) in a lending decision: Figure 14. Boxed function expression with an included PMML model in business knowledge model A boxed invocation expression in DMN is a boxed expression that invokes a business knowledge model. A boxed invocation expression contains the name of the business knowledge model to be invoked and a list of parameter bindings. Each binding is represented by two boxed expressions on a row: The box on the left contains the name of a parameter and the box on the right contains the binding expression whose value is assigned to the parameter to evaluate the invoked business knowledge model. You use boxed invocations to invoke at a particular decision node a business knowledge model defined in the decision model. For example, the following boxed invocation expression invokes a Reassign Next Passenger business knowledge model as the concluding decision node in a flight-rebooking decision model: Figure 15. Boxed invocation expression to reassign flight passengers The following boxed invocation expression invokes an InstallmentCalculation business knowledge model to calculate a monthly installment amount for a loan before proceeding to affordability decisions: Figure 16. Boxed invocation expression for required monthly installment A boxed list expression in DMN represents a FEEL list of items. You use boxed lists to define lists of relevant items for a particular node in a decision. You can also use literal FEEL expressions for list items in cells to create more complex lists. For example, the following boxed list expression identifies approved credit score agencies in a loan application decision service: Figure 17. Boxed list expression for approved credit score agencies The following boxed list expression also identifies approved credit score agencies but uses FEEL logic to define the agency status (Inc., LLC, SA, GA) based on a DMN input node: Figure 18. Boxed list expression using FEEL logic for approved credit score agency status The following is a real-world DMN model example that demonstrates how you can use decision modeling to reach a decision based on input data, circumstances, and company guidelines. In this scenario, a flight from San Diego to New York is canceled, requiring the affected airline to find alternate arrangements for its inconvenienced passengers. First, the airline collects the information necessary to determine how best to get the travelers to their destinations: Input data List of flights List of passengers Decisions Prioritize the passengers who will get seats on a new flight Determine which flights those passengers will be offered Business knowledge models The company process for determining passenger priority Any flights that have space available Company rules for determining how best to reassign inconvenienced passengers The airline then uses the DMN standard to model its decision process in the following decision requirements diagram (DRD) for determining the best rebooking solution: Figure 19. DRD for flight rebooking Similar to flowcharts, DRDs use shapes to represent the different elements in a process. Ovals contain the two necessary input data, rectangles contain the decision points in the model, and rectangles with clipped corners (business knowledge models) contain reusable logic that can be repeatedly invoked. The DRD draws logic for each element from boxed expressions that provide variable definitions using FEEL expressions or data type values. Some boxed expressions are basic, such as the following decision for establishing a prioritized waiting list: Figure 20. Boxed context expression example for prioritized wait list Some boxed expressions are more complex with greater detail and calculation, such as the following business knowledge model for reassigning the next delayed passenger: Figure 21. Boxed function expression for passenger reassignment The following is the DMN source file for this decision model: feel:string feel:string feel:string feel:dateTime feel:dateTime feel:number feel:string tFlight feel:string feel:string feel:number feel:string tPassenger feel:string Flight List[ Status = \"cancelled\" ].Flight Number Passenger List[ list contains( Cancelled Flights, Flight Number ) ] sort( Waiting List, passenger priority ) reassign next passenger Prioritized Waiting List [] Flight List Passenger1.Status \"gold\", \"silver\", \"bronze\" Passenger2.Status \"gold\", \"silver\", \"bronze\" Passenger1.Miles true, false false \"gold\" \"gold\" >= Passenger2.Miles true \"gold\" \"silver\",\"bronze\" - true \"silver\" \"silver\" >= Passenger2.Miles true \"silver\" \"bronze\" - true \"bronze\" \"bronze\" >= Passenger2.Miles true Waiting List[1] Flights[ Flight Number = Next Passenger.Flight Number ][1] Flights[ From = Original Flight.From and To = Original Flight.To and Departure > Original Flight.Departure and Status = \"scheduled\" and has capacity( item, Reassigned Passengers List ) ][1] Next Passenger.Name Next Passenger.Status Next Passenger.Miles Best Alternate Flight.Flight Number remove( Waiting List, 1 ) append( Reassigned Passengers List, Reassigned Passenger ) if count( Remaining Waiting List ) > 0 then reassign next passenger( Remaining Waiting List, Updated Reassigned Passengers List, Flights ) else Updated Reassigned Passengers List flight.Capacity > count( rebooked list[ Flight Number = flight.Flight Number ] ) Drools DMN engine provides runtime support for DMN 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 models at conformance level 3. KIE DMN Editor provides design support for DMN 1.2 models at conformance level 3. You can integrate DMN models with your Drools decision services in several ways: Design your DMN models using the KIE DMN Editor online. Design your DMN models using the KIE DMN Editor in VSCode. Import DMN files into your project by opening them in KIE DMN Editor. Any DMN 1.1 and 1.3 models (do not contain DMN 1.3 features) that you import or open into KIE DMN Editor and save are converted to DMN 1.2 models. Package DMN files as part of your project knowledge JAR (KJAR) file without KIE DMN Editor. The following table summarizes the design and runtime support for each DMN version in Drools: Table 3. DMN support in Drools DMN version DMN engine support DMN modeler support Execution Open Save DMN 1.1 ✅ yes ✅ yes ❌ no DMN 1.2 ✅ yes ✅ yes ✅ yes DMN 1.3 ✅ yes ✅ yes ❌ no DMN 1.4 ✅ yes ❌ no ❌ no In addition to all DMN conformance level 3 requirements, Drools DMN engine also includes enhancements and fixes to FEEL and DMN model components to optimize the experience of implementing DMN decision services with Drools. From a platform perspective, DMN models are like any other business asset in Drools, such as DRL files or spreadsheet decision tables, that you can include in your Drools project and deploy in order to start your DMN decision services. For more information about including external DMN files with your Drools project packaging and deployment method, see the Build, Deploy, Utilize and Run section. You can design a new DMN decision service using a Kogito microservice as an alternative for the cloud-native capabilities of DMN decision services. You could also migrate your existing DMN service to a Kogito microservice. For more information about Kogito or migrating to Kogito microservices, see the Kogito website for documentation. Drools DMN engine includes the following enhancements and other changes to FEEL in the current DMN implementation: Space Sensitivity: This DMN implementation of the FEEL language is space insensitive. The goal is to avoid non-deterministic behavior based on the context and differences in behavior based on invisible characters, such as white spaces. This means that for this implementation, a variable named first name with one space is exactly the same as first name with two spaces in it. List functions or() and and() : The specification defines two list functions named or() and and(). However, according to the FEEL grammar, these are not valid function names, as and and or are reserved keywords. This implementation renames these functions to any() and all() respectively, in anticipation for DMN 1.2. Keyword in cannot be used in variable names: The specification defines that any keyword can be reused as part of a variable name, but the ambiguities caused with the for …​ in …​ return loop prevent the reuse of the in keyword. All other keywords are supported as part of variable names. Keywords are not supported in attributes of anonymous types: FEEL is not a strongly typed language and the parser must resolve ambiguity in name parts of an attribute of an anonymous type. The parser supports reusable keywords as part of a variable name defined in the scope, but the parser does not support keywords in attributes of an anonymous type. For example, for item in Order.items return Federal Tax for Item( item ) is a valid and supported FEEL expression, where a function named Federal Tax for Item(…​) can be defined and invoked correctly in the scope. However, the expression for i in [ {x and y : true, n : 1}, {x and y : false, n: 2} ] return i.x and y is not supported because anonymous types are defined in the iteration context of the for expression and the parser cannot resolve the ambiguity. Support for date and time literals on ranges: According to the grammar rules #8, #18, #19, #34 and #62, date and time literals are supported in ranges (pages 110-111). Chapter 10.3.2.7 on page 114, on the other hand, contradicts the grammar and says they are not supported. This implementation chose to follow the grammar and support date and time literals on ranges, as well as extend the specification to support any arbitrary expression (see extensions below). Invalid time syntax: Chapter 10.3.2.3.4 on page 112 and bullet point about time on page 131 both state that the time string lexical representation follows the XML Schema Datatypes specification as well as ISO 8601. According to the XML Schema specification (https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#time), the lexical representation of a time follows the pattern hh:mm:ss.sss without any leading character. The DMN specification uses a leading \"T\" in several examples, that we understand is a typo and not in accordance with the standard. Support for scientific and hexadecimal notations: This implementation supports scientific and hexadecimal notation for numbers. For example, 1.2e5 (scientific notation), 0xD5 (hexadecimal notation). Support for expressions as end points in ranges: This implementation supports expressions as endpoints for ranges. For example, [date(\"2016-11-24\")..date(\"2016-11-27\")] Support for additional types: The specification only defines the following as basic types of the language: number string boolean days and time duration years and month duration time date and time For completeness and orthogonality, this implementation also supports the following types: context list range function unary test Support for unary tests: For completeness and orthogonality, unary tests are supported as first class citizens in the language. They are functions with an implicit single parameter and can be invoked in the same way as functions. For example, UnaryTestAsFunction.feel { is minor : Alternatively, you can configure this property globally for your Drools environment; modify this property using a command terminal or any other global application configuration mechanism. -Dorg.kie.dmn.runtime.listeners.mylistener=org.acme.MyDMNListener By default, the kie-maven-plugin component in the pom.xml file of your Drools project uses the following configurations to perform pre-compilation validation of DMN model assets and to perform DMN decision table static analysis: VALIDATE_SCHEMA: DMN model files are verified against the DMN specification XSD schema to ensure that the files are valid XML and compliant with the specification. VALIDATE_MODEL: The pre-compilation analysis is performed for the DMN model to ensure that the basic semantic is aligned with the DMN specification. ANALYZE_DECISION_TABLE: DMN decision tables are statically analyzed for gaps or overlaps and to ensure that the semantic of the decision table follows best practices. You can modify the default DMN validation and DMN decision table analysis behavior to perform only a specified validation during the project build, or you can disable this default behavior completely, as shown in the following examples: Default configuration for DMN validation and decision table analysis org.kie kie-maven-plugin true VALIDATE_SCHEMA,VALIDATE_MODEL,ANALYZE_DECISION_TABLE Configuration to perform only the DMN decision table static analysis org.kie kie-maven-plugin true ANALYZE_DECISION_TABLE Configuration to perform only the XSD schema validation org.kie kie-maven-plugin true VALIDATE_SCHEMA Configuration to perform only the DMN model validation org.kie kie-maven-plugin true VALIDATE_MODEL Configuration to disable all DMN validation org.kie kie-maven-plugin true disable If you enter an unrecognized configuration flag, all pre-compilation validation is disabled and the Maven plugin emits related log messages. You can use the KIE DMN Editor to design DMN decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) and define decision logic for a complete and functional DMN decision model. Drools provides design support for DMN 1.2 models at conformance level 3, and includes enhancements and fixes to FEEL and DMN model components to optimize the experience of implementing DMN decision services with Drools. Drools DMN engine also provides runtime support for DMN 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 models at conformance level 3, but any DMN 1.1 and 1.3 models (do not contain DMN 1.3 features) that you import or open into KIE DMN Editor and save are converted to DMN 1.2 models Procedure Create or import a DMN file in your KIE DMN Editor. To create a DMN file, follow the instruction on the KIE DMN Editor online, or create a new .dmn file in VSCode. To import an existing DMN file, follow the instruction on the KIE DMN Editor online, or double click to open a .dmn file in VSCode. If you imported a DMN file that does not contain layout information, the imported decision requirements diagram (DRD) is formatted automatically in the DMN designer. Click Save in the DMN designer to save the DRD layout. If an imported DRD is not automatically formatted, you can select the Perform automatic layout icon in the upper-right toolbar in the DMN designer to format the DRD. Begin adding components to your new or imported DMN decision requirements diagram (DRD) by clicking and dragging one of the DMN nodes from the left toolbar: Figure 22. Adding DRD components The following DRD components are available: Decision: Use this node for a DMN decision, where one or more input elements determine an output based on defined decision logic. Business knowledge model: Use this node for reusable functions with one or more decision elements. Decisions that have the same logic but depend on different sub-input data or sub-decisions use business knowledge models to determine which procedure to follow. Knowledge source: Use this node for external authorities, documents, committees, or policies that regulate a decision or business knowledge model. Knowledge sources are references to real-world factors rather than executable business rules. Input data: Use this node for information used in a decision node or a business knowledge model. Input data usually includes business-level concepts or objects relevant to the business, such as loan applicant data used in a lending strategy. Text annotation: Use this node for explanatory notes associated with an input data node, decision node, business knowledge model, or knowledge source. Decision service: Use this node to enclose a set of reusable decisions implemented as a decision service for invocation. A decision service can be used in other DMN models and can be invoked from an external application or a BPMN business process. In the DMN designer canvas, double-click the new DRD node to enter an informative node name. If the node is a decision or business knowledge model, select the node to display the node options and click the Edit icon to open the DMN boxed expression designer to define the decision logic for the node: Figure 23. Opening a new decision node boxed expression Figure 24. Opening a new business knowledge model boxed expression By default, all business knowledge models are defined as boxed function expressions containing a literal FEEL expression, a nested context expression of an external JAVA or PMML function, or a nested boxed expression of any type. For decision nodes, you click the undefined table to select the type of boxed expression you want to use, such as a boxed literal expression, boxed context expression, decision table, or other DMN boxed expression. Figure 25. Selecting the logic type for a decision node For business knowledge models, you click the top-left function cell to select the function type, or right-click the function value cell, select Clear, and select a boxed expression of another type. Figure 26. Selecting the function or other logic type for a business knowledge model In the selected boxed expression designer for either a decision node (any expression type) or business knowledge model (function expression), click the applicable table cells to define the table name, variable data types, variable names and values, function parameters and bindings, or FEEL expressions to include in the decision logic. You can right-click cells for additional actions where applicable, such as inserting or removing table rows and columns or clearing table contents. The following is an example decision table for a decision node that determines credit score ratings based on a defined range of a loan applicant’s credit score: Figure 27. Decision node decision table for credit score rating The following is an example boxed function expression for a business knowledge model that calculates mortgage payments based on principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI) as a literal expression: Figure 28. Business knowledge model function for PITI calculation After you define the decision logic for the selected node, click Back to \"\" to return to the DRD view. For the selected DRD node, use the available connection options to create and connect to the next node in the DRD, or click and drag a new node onto the DRD canvas from the left toolbar. The node type determines which connection options are supported. For example, an Input data node can connect to a decision node, knowledge source, or text annotation using the applicable connection type, whereas a Knowledge source node can connect to any DRD element. A Decision node can connect only to another decision or a text annotation. The following connection types are available, depending on the node type: Information requirement: Use this connection from an input data node or decision node to another decision node that requires the information. Knowledge requirement: Use this connection from a business knowledge model to a decision node or to another business knowledge model that invokes the decision logic. Authority requirement: Use this connection from an input data node or a decision node to a dependent knowledge source or from a knowledge source to a decision node, business knowledge model, or another knowledge source. Association: Use this connection from an input data node, decision node, business knowledge model, or knowledge source to a text annotation. Figure 29. Connecting credit score input to the credit score rating decision Continue adding and defining the remaining DRD components of your decision model. Periodically click Save in the DMN designer to save your work. As you periodically save a DRD, the DMN designer performs a static validation of the DMN model and might produce error messages until the model is defined completely. After you finish defining the DMN model completely, if any errors remain, troubleshoot the specified problems accordingly. After you add and define all components of the DRD, click Save to save and validate the completed DRD. To adjust the DRD layout, you can select the Perform automatic layout icon in the upper-right toolbar of the DMN designer. The following is an example DRD for a loan prequalification decision model: Figure 30. Completed DRD for loan prequalification The following is an example DRD for a phone call handling decision model using a reusable decision service: Figure 31. Completed DRD for phone call handling with a decision service In a DMN decision service node, the decision nodes in the bottom segment incorporate input data from outside of the decision service to arrive at a final decision in the top segment of the decision service node. The resulting top-level decisions from the decision service are then implemented in any subsequent decisions or business knowledge requirements of the DMN model. You can reuse DMN decision services in other DMN models to apply the same decision logic with different input data and different outgoing connections. Boxed expressions in DMN are tables that you use to define the underlying logic of decision nodes and business knowledge models in a decision requirements diagram (DRD). Some boxed expressions can contain other boxed expressions, but the top-level boxed expression corresponds to the decision logic of a single DRD artifact. While DRDs represent the flow of a DMN decision model, boxed expressions define the actual decision logic of individual nodes. DRDs and boxed expressions together form a complete and functional DMN decision model. You can use the KIE DMN Editor to define decision logic for your DRD components using built-in boxed expressions. Prerequisites A DMN file is created or imported in KIE DMN Editor. Procedure In the DMN designer canvas, select a decision node or business knowledge model node that you want to define and click the Edit icon to open the DMN boxed expression designer: Figure 32. Opening a new decision node boxed expression Figure 33. Opening a new business knowledge model boxed expression By default, all business knowledge models are defined as boxed function expressions containing a literal FEEL expression, a nested context expression of an external JAVA or PMML function, or a nested boxed expression of any type. For decision nodes, you click the undefined table to select the type of boxed expression you want to use, such as a boxed literal expression, boxed context expression, decision table, or other DMN boxed expression. Figure 34. Selecting the logic type for a decision node For business knowledge model nodes, you click the top-left function cell to select the function type, or right-click the function value cell, select Clear, and select a boxed expression of another type. Figure 35. Selecting the function or other logic type for a business knowledge model For this example, use a decision node and select Decision Table as the boxed expression type. A decision table in DMN is a visual representation of one or more rules in a tabular format. Each rule consists of a single row in the table, and includes columns that define the conditions (input) and outcome (output) for that particular row. Click the input column header to define the name and data type for the input condition. For example, name the input column Credit Score.FICO with a number data type. This column specifies numeric credit score values or ranges of loan applicants. Click the output column header to define the name and data type for the output values. For example, name the output column Credit Score Rating and next to the Data Type option, click Manage to go to the Data Types page where you can create a custom data type with score ratings as constraints. Figure 36. Managing data types for a column header value On the Data Types page, click New Data Type to add a new data type or click Import Data Object to import an existing data object from your project that you want to use as a DMN data type. If you import a data object from your project as a DMN data type and then that object is updated, you must re-import the data object as a DMN data type to apply the changes in your DMN model. For this example, click New Data Type and create a Credit_Score_Rating data type as a string: Figure 37. Adding a new data type Click Add Constraints, select Enumeration from the drop-down options, and add the following constraints: \"Excellent\" \"Good\" \"Fair\" \"Poor\" \"Bad\" Figure 38. Adding constraints to the new data type To change the order of data type constraints, you can click the left end of the constraint row and drag the row as needed: Figure 39. Dragging constraints to change constraint order For information about constraint types and syntax requirements for the specified data type, see the Decision Model and Notation specification. Click OK to save the constraints and click the check mark to the right of the data type to save the data type. Return to the Credit Score Rating decision table, click the Credit Score Rating column header, and set the data type to this new custom data type. Use the Credit Score.FICO input column to define credit score values or ranges of values, and use the Credit Score Rating column to specify one of the corresponding ratings you defined in the Credit_Score_Rating data type. Right-click any value cell to insert or delete rows (rules) or columns (clauses). Figure 40. Decision node decision table for credit score rating After you define all rules, click the top-left corner of the decision table to define the rule Hit Policy and Builtin Aggregator (for COLLECT hit policy only). The hit policy determines how to reach an outcome when multiple rules in a decision table match the provided input values. The built-in aggregator determines how to aggregate rule values when you use the COLLECT hit policy. Figure 41. Defining the decision table hit policy The following example is a more complex decision table that determines applicant qualification for a loan as the concluding decision node in the same loan prequalification decision model: Figure 42. Decision table for loan prequalification For boxed expression types other than decision tables, you follow these guidelines similarly to navigate the boxed expression tables and define variables and parameters for decision logic, but according to the requirements of the boxed expression type. Some boxed expressions, such as boxed literal expressions, can be single-column tables, while other boxed expressions, such as function, context, and invocation expressions, can be multi-column tables with nested boxed expressions of other types. For example, the following boxed context expression defines the parameters that determine whether a loan applicant can meet minimum mortgage payments based on principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI), represented as a front-end ratio calculation with a sub-context expression: Figure 43. Boxed context expression for front-end client PITI ratio The following boxed function expression determines a monthly mortgage installment as a business knowledge model in a lending decision, with the function value defined as a nested context expression: Figure 44. Boxed function expression for installment calculation in business knowledge model For more information and examples of each boxed expression type, see DMN decision logic in boxed expressions. In DMN boxed expressions in KIE DMN Editor, data types determine the structure of the data that you use within an associated table, column, or field in the boxed expression. You can use default DMN data types (such as String, Number, Boolean) or you can create custom data types to specify additional fields and constraints that you want to implement for the boxed expression values. Custom data types that you create for a boxed expression can be simple or structured: Simple data types have only a name and a type assignment. Example: Age (number). Structured data types contain multiple fields associated with a parent data type. Example: A single type Person containing the fields Name (string), Age (number), Email (string). Prerequisites A DMN file is created or imported in KIE DMN Editor. Procedure In the DMN designer canvas, select a decision node or business knowledge model for which you want to define the data types and click the Edit icon to open the DMN boxed expression designer. If the boxed expression is for a decision node that is not yet defined, click the undefined table to select the type of boxed expression you want to use, such as a boxed literal expression, boxed context expression, decision table, or other DMN boxed expression. Figure 45. Selecting the logic type for a decision node Click the cell for the table header, column header, or parameter field (depending on the boxed expression type) for which you want to define the data type and click Manage to go to the Data Types page where you can create a custom data type. Figure 46. Managing data types for a column header value You can also set and manage custom data types for a specified decision node or business knowledge model node by selecting the Properties icon in the upper-right corner of the DMN designer: Figure 47. Managing data types in decision requirements diagram (DRD) properties The data type that you define for a specified cell in a boxed expression determines the structure of the data that you use within that associated table, column, or field in the boxed expression. In this example, an output column Credit Score Rating for a DMN decision table defines a set of custom credit score ratings based on an applicant’s credit score. On the Data Types page, click New Data Type to add a new data type or click Import Data Object to import an existing data object from your project that you want to use as a DMN data type. If you import a data object from your project as a DMN data type and then that object is updated, you must re-import the data object as a DMN data type to apply the changes in your DMN model. For this example, click New Data Type and create a Credit_Score_Rating data type as a string: Figure 48. Adding a new data type If the data type requires a list of items, enable the List setting. Click Add Constraints, select Enumeration from the drop-down options, and add the following constraints: \"Excellent\" \"Good\" \"Fair\" \"Poor\" \"Bad\" Figure 49. Adding constraints to the new data type To change the order of data type constraints, you can click the left end of the constraint row and drag the row as needed: Figure 50. Dragging constraints to change constraint order For information about constraint types and syntax requirements for the specified data type, see the Decision Model and Notation specification. Click OK to save the constraints and click the check mark to the right of the data type to save the data type. Return to the Credit Score Rating decision table, click the Credit Score Rating column header, set the data type to this new custom data type, and define the rule values for that column with the rating constraints that you specified. Figure 51. Decision table for credit score rating In the DMN decision model for this scenario, the Credit Score Rating decision flows into the following Loan Prequalification decision that also requires custom data types: Figure 52. Decision table for loan prequalification Continuing with this example, return to the Data Types window, click New Data Type, and create a Loan_Qualification data type as a Structure with no constraints. When you save the new structured data type, the first sub-field appears so that you can begin defining nested data fields in this parent data type. You can use these sub-fields in association with the parent structured data type in boxed expressions, such as nested column headers in decision tables or nested table parameters in context or function expressions. For additional sub-fields, select the addition icon next to the Loan_Qualification data type: Figure 53. Adding a new structured data type with nested fields For this example, under the structured Loan_Qualification data type, add a Qualification field with \"Qualified\" and \"Not Qualified\" enumeration constraints, and a Reason field with no constraints. Add also a simple Back_End_Ratio and a Front_End_Ratio data type, both with \"Sufficient\" and \"Insufficient\" enumeration constraints. Click the check mark to the right of each data type that you create to save your changes. Figure 54. Adding nested data types with constraints To change the order or nesting of data types, you can click the left end of the data type row and drag the row as needed: Figure 55. Dragging data types to change data type order or nesting Return to the decision table and, for each column, click the column header cell, set the data type to the new corresponding custom data type, and define the rule values as needed for the column with the constraints that you specified, if applicable. Figure 56. Decision table for loan prequalification For boxed expression types other than decision tables, you follow these guidelines similarly to navigate the boxed expression tables and define custom data types as needed. For example, the following boxed function expression uses custom tCandidate and tProfile structured data types to associate data for online dating compatibility: Figure 57. Boxed function expression for online dating compatibility Figure 58. Custom data type definitions for online dating compatibility Figure 59. Parameter definitions with custom data types for online dating compatibility In the KIE DMN Editor, you can use the Included Models tab to include other DMN models and Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) models from your project in a specified DMN file. When you include a DMN model within another DMN file, you can use all of the nodes and logic from both models in the same decision requirements diagram (DRD). When you include a PMML model within a DMN file, you can invoke that PMML model as a boxed function expression for a DMN decision node or business knowledge model node. You cannot include DMN or PMML models from other projects in KIE DMN Editor. In KIE DMN Editor, you can include other DMN models from your project in a specified DMN file. When you include a DMN model within another DMN file, you can use all of the nodes and logic from both models in the same decision requirements diagram (DRD), but you cannot edit the nodes from the included model. To edit nodes from included models, you must update the source file for the included model directly. If you update the source file for an included DMN model, open the DMN file where the DMN model is included (or close an re-open) to verify the changes. You cannot include DMN models from other projects in KIE DMN Editor. Prerequisites The DMN models are created or imported (as .dmn files) in the same project in KIE DMN Editor as the DMN file in which you want to include the models. Procedure In the KIE DMN Editor, click the Included Models tab. Click Include Model, select a DMN model from your project in the Models list, enter a unique name for the included model, and click Include: Figure 60. Including a DMN model The DMN model is added to this DMN file, and all DRD nodes from the included model are listed under Decision Components in the Decision Navigator view: Figure 61. DMN file with decision components from the included DMN model All data types from the included model are also listed in read-only mode in the Data Types tab for the DMN file: Figure 62. DMN file with data types from the included DMN model In the Model tab of the DMN designer, click and drag the included DRD components onto the canvas to begin implementing them in your DRD: Figure 63. Adding DRD components from the included DMN model To edit DRD nodes or data types from included models, you must update the source file for the included model directly. If you update the source file for an included DMN model, open the DMN file where the DMN model is included (or close an re-open) to verify the changes. To edit the included model name or to remove the included model from the DMN file, use the Included Models tab in the DMN designer. When you remove an included model, any nodes from that included model that are currently used in the DRD are also removed. In KIE DMN Editor, you can include Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) models from your project in a specified DMN file. When you include a PMML model within a DMN file, you can invoke that PMML model as a boxed function expression for a DMN decision node or business knowledge model node. If you update the source file for an included PMML model, you must remove and re-include the PMML model in the DMN file to apply the source changes. You cannot include PMML models from other projects in KIE DMN Editor. Prerequisites The PMML models are imported (as .pmml files) in the same project in KIE DMN Editor as the DMN file in which you want to include the models. Procedure In your DMN project, add the following dependencies to the project pom.xml file to enable PMML evaluation: org.drools kie-pmml-trusty ${drools.version} provided org.kie kie-dmn-jpmml ${drools.version} provided org.jpmml pmml-evaluator 1.5.1 provided org.jpmml pmml-evaluator-extension 1.5.1 provided If you want to use the full PMML specification implementation with the Java Evaluator API for PMML (JPMML), use the alternative set of JPMML dependencies in your DMN project. If the JPMML dependencies and the standard kie-pmml-trusty dependency are both present, the kie-pmml-trusty dependency is disabled. For information about JPMML licensing terms, see Openscoring.io. The legacy kie-pmml dependency is deprecated with Drools 7.48.0 and was be replaced by kie-pmml-trusty dependency in the following Drools release. Instead of specifying a Drools for individual dependencies, consider adding the Drools bill of materials (BOM) dependency to dependencyManagement section of your project pom.xml file. When you add the BOM files, the correct versions of transitive dependencies from the provided Maven repositories are included in the project. Example BOM dependency: org.kie kie-dmn-bom ${drools.version} import pom If you added the JPMML dependencies in your DMN project to use the JPMML Evaluator, download the following JAR files and add them to the classpath (in traditional KIE Server deployment these were needed in the ~/kie-server.war/WEB-INF/lib and ~/business-central.war/WEB-INF/lib directories of the distribution): KIE JPMML Integration 10.0.0.Final JAR file from the online Maven repository JPMML Evaluator 1.5.1 JAR file from the online Maven repository JPMML Evaluator Extensions 1.5.1 JAR file from the online Maven repository These artifacts are required to enable JPMML evaluation. We provide these additional plug-in modules to support the integration with the Java Evaluator API for PMML (JPMML) for PMML execution in Drools. However, we do not support the JPMML libraries directly. If you include JPMML libraries in your Drools distribution, see the Openscoring.io licensing terms for JPMML. In the KIE DMN Editor, click the Included Models tab. Click Include Model, select a PMML model from your project in the Models list, enter a unique name for the included model, and click Include: Figure 64. Including a PMML model The PMML model is added to this DMN file: Figure 65. DMN file with included PMML model In the Model tab of the DMN designer, select or create the decision node or business knowledge model node in which you want to invoke the PMML model and click the Edit icon to open the DMN boxed expression designer: Figure 66. Opening a new decision node boxed expression Figure 67. Opening a new business knowledge model boxed expression Set the expression type to Function (default for business knowledge model nodes), click the top-left function cell, and select PMML. In the document and model rows in the table, double-click the undefined cells to specify the included PMML document and the relevant PMML model within that document: Figure 68. Adding a PMML model in a DMN business knowledge model Figure 69. Example PMML definition in a DMN business knowledge model If you update the source file for an included PMML model, you must remove and re-include the PMML model in the DMN file to apply the source changes. To edit the included model name or to remove the included model from the DMN file, use the Included Models tab in the DMN designer. For complex DMN models, you can use the DMN designer in KIE DMN Editor to design multiple DMN decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) that represent parts of the overall decision requirements graph (DRG) for the DMN decision model. In simple cases, you can use a single DRD to represent all of the overall DRG for the decision model, but in complex cases, a single DRD can become large and difficult to follow. Therefore, to better organize DMN decision models with many decision requirements, you can divide the model into smaller nested DRDs that constitute the larger central DRD representation of the overall DRG. Prerequisites You understand how to design DRDs in KIE DMN Editor. For information about creating DRDs, see Creating and editing DMN models in KIE DMN Editor. Procedure In KIE DMN Editor, navigate to your DMN project and create or import a DMN file in the project. Open the new or imported DMN file to view the DRD in the DMN designer, and begin designing or modifying the DRD using the DMN nodes in the left toolbar. For any DMN nodes that you want to define in a separate nested DRD, select the node, click the DRD Actions icon, and select from the available options. Figure 70. DRD actions icon for subdividing a DRD The following options are available: Create: Use this option to create a nested DRD where you can separately define the DMN components and diagram for the selected node. Add to: If you already created a nested DRD, use this option to add the selected node to an existing DRD. Remove: If the node that you selected is already within a nested DRD, use this option to remove the node from that nested DRD. After you create a nested DRD within your DMN decision model, the new DRD opens in a separate DRD canvas and the available DRD and components are listed in the Decision Navigator left menu. You can use the Decision Navigator menu to rename or remove a nested DRD. Figure 71. Rename new nested DRD in the Decision Navigator menu In the separate canvas for the new nested DRD, design the flow and logic for all required components in this portion of the DMN model, as usual. Continue adding and defining any other nested DRDs for your decision model and save the completed DMN file. For example, the following DRD for a loan prequalification decision model contains all DMN components for the model without any nested DRDs. This example relies on the single DRD for all components and logic, resulting in a large and complex diagram. Figure 72. Single DRD for loan prequalification Alternatively, by following the steps in this procedure, you can divide this example DRD into multiple nested DRDs to better organize the decision requirements, as shown in the following example: Figure 73. Multiple nested DRDs for loan prequalification Figure 74. Overview of front end ratio DRD Figure 75. DRD for front end ratio Figure 76. Overview of credit score rating DRD Figure 77. DRD for credit score rating Figure 78. Overview of back end ratio DRD Figure 79. DRD for back end ratio In the KIE DMN Editor, you can use the Documentation tab to generate a report of your DMN model that you can print or download as an HTML file for offline use. The DMN model report contains all decision requirements diagrams (DRDs), data types, and boxed expressions in your DMN model. You can use this report to share your DMN model details or as part of your internal reporting workflow. Figure 80. Example DMN model report The DMN designer in KIE DMN Editor provides the following additional features to help you navigate through the components and properties of decision requirements diagrams (DRDs). DMN file and diagram views In the upper-left corner of the DMN designer, select the Project Explorer view to navigate between all DMN and other files or select the Decision Navigator view to navigate between the decision components, graphs, and boxed expressions of a selected DRD: Figure 81. Project Explorer view Figure 82. Decision Navigator view The DRD components from any DMN models included in the DMN file (in the Included Models tab) are also listed in the Decision Components panel for the DMN file. In the upper-right corner of the DMN designer, select the Explore diagram icon to view an elevated preview of the selected DRD and to navigate between the nodes of the selected DRD: Figure 83. Explore diagram view DRD properties and design In the upper-right corner of the DMN designer, select the Properties icon to modify the identifying information, data types, and appearance of a selected DRD, DRD node, or boxed expression cell: Figure 84. DRD node properties To view the properties of the entire DRD, click the DRD canvas background instead of a specific node. DRD search In the upper-right corner of the DMN designer, use the search bar to search for text that appears in your DRD. The search feature is especially helpful in complex DRDs with many nodes: Figure 85. DRD search DMN decision service details Select a decision service node in the DMN designer to view additional properties, including Input Data, Encapsulated Decisions, and Output Decisions in the Properties panel. Figure 86. Decision Service details You can create or import DMN files in your Drools project using KIE DMN Editor or package the DMN files as part of your project knowledge JAR (KJAR) file without KIE DMN Editor. After you implement your DMN files in your Drools project, you can execute the DMN decision service by instantiating a KIE container that contains it directly as a dependency of the calling application. Other options for creating and deploying DMN knowledge packages are also available, and most are similar for all types of knowledge assets, such as DRL files or process definitions. Alternatively, you could package your DMN files as part of a Kogito cloud-native microservice. For information about including external DMN assets with your project packaging and deployment method, see the Build, Deploy, Utilize and Run section. A KIE container is local when the knowledge assets are either embedded directly into the calling program or are physically pulled in using Maven dependencies for the KJAR. You typically embed knowledge assets directly into a project if there is a tight relationship between the version of the code and the version of the DMN definition. Any changes to the decision take effect after you have intentionally updated and redeployed the application. A benefit of this approach is that proper operation does not rely on any external dependencies to the run time, which can be a limitation of locked-down environments. Using Maven dependencies enables further flexibility because the specific version of the decision can dynamically change, (for example, by using a kmodule.xml or a system property), and it can be periodically scanned for updates and automatically updated. This introduces an external dependency on the deploy time of the service, but executes the decision locally, reducing reliance on an external service being available during run time. Prerequisites You have built the DMN project as a KJAR artifact and deployed it to a Maven repository, or you have included your DMN assets as part of your project classpath: mvn clean install For more information about project packaging and deployment and executable models, see the Build, Deploy, Utilize and Run section. Procedure In your client application, add the following dependencies to the relevant classpath of your Java project: org.kie kie-dmn-core ${drools.version} org.kie kie-ci ${drools.version} The is the Maven artifact version for Drools currently used in your project (for example, 10.0.0.Final). Instead of specifying a Drools for individual dependencies, consider adding the Drools bill of materials (BOM) dependency to dependencyManagement section of your project pom.xml file. When you add the BOM files, the correct versions of transitive dependencies from the provided Maven repositories are included in the project. Example BOM dependency: org.kie kie-dmn-bom ${drools.version} import pom Create a KIE container from classpath or ReleaseId: KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get(); ReleaseId releaseId = kieServices.newReleaseId( \"org.acme\", \"my-kjar\", \"1.0.0\" ); KieContainer kieContainer = kieServices.newKieContainer( releaseId ); Alternative option: KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieContainer kieContainer = kieServices.getKieClasspathContainer(); Obtain DMNRuntime from the KIE container and a reference to the DMN model to be evaluated, by using the model namespace and modelName: DMNRuntime dmnRuntime = KieRuntimeFactory.of(kieContainer.getKieBase()).get(DMNRuntime.class); String namespace = \"http://www.redhat.com/_c7328033-c355-43cd-b616-0aceef80e52a\"; String modelName = \"dmn-movieticket-ageclassification\"; DMNModel dmnModel = dmnRuntime.getModel(namespace, modelName); Execute the decision services for the desired model: DMNContext dmnContext = dmnRuntime.newContext(); (1) for (Integer age : Arrays.asList(1,12,13,64,65,66)) { dmnContext.set(\"Age\", age); (2) DMNResult dmnResult = dmnRuntime.evaluateAll(dmnModel, dmnContext); (3) for (DMNDecisionResult dr : dmnResult.getDecisionResults()) { (4) log.info(\"Age: \" + age + \", \" + \"Decision: '\" + dr.getDecisionName() + \"', \" + \"Result: \" + dr.getResult()); } } 1 Instantiate a new DMN Context to be the input for the model evaluation. Note that this example is looping through the Age Classification decision multiple times. 2 Assign input variables for the input DMN context. 3 Evaluate all DMN decisions defined in the DMN model. 4 Each evaluation may result in one or more results, creating the loop. This example prints the following output: Age 1 Decision 'AgeClassification' : Child Age 12 Decision 'AgeClassification' : Child Age 13 Decision 'AgeClassification' : Adult Age 64 Decision 'AgeClassification' : Adult Age 65 Decision 'AgeClassification' : Senior Age 66 Decision 'AgeClassification' : Senior Interacting with the REST endpoints of Kogito cloud-native microservice including DMN models provides the most separation between the calling code and the decision logic definition. The calling code is completely free of direct dependencies, and you can implement it in an entirely different development platform such as Node.js or .NET. For a quick getting started guide for Kogito on Quarkus, see the Quarkus guide for using Kogito DMN support to add Decision Automation capabilities to a Quarkus application.

The declarative agenda allows to use rules to control which other rules can fire and when. While this will add a lot more overhead than the simple use of salience, the advantage is it is declarative and thus more readable and maintainable and should allow more use cases to be achieved in a simpler fashion. As this feature is highly experimental and will be subject to change, it is off by default and must be explicitly enabled. It can be activated on a given KieBase by adding the declarativeAgenda=\"enabled\" attribute in the corresponding kbase tag of the kmodule.xml file, as is specified in the following example. Example 1. Enabling the Declarative Agenda The basic idea is: All rule’s matches are inserted into working memory as facts, represented as instances of Match class. So you can now do pattern matching against a Match instance. The rule’s metadata and declarations are available as fields on the Match instance. You can use the kcontext.blockMatch(Match match) call in a rule to block a selected match. Only when that rule becomes false will the match be eligible for firing. If it is already eligible for firing and is later blocked, it will be removed from the agenda until it is unblocked. A match may have multiple blockers, so a count is kept. All blockers must become false for the counter to reach zero to enable the Match to be eligible for firing. kcontext.unblockAllMatches(Match match) is an over-ride rule that will remove all blockers regardless. An internalMatch may also be cancelled using cancelMatch call, so it never fires. An unblocked Match is added to the agenda and obeys normal salience, agenda groups, ruleflow groups etc. definitions. The @Direct annotation allows a rule to fire as soon as it’s matched. This is supposed to be used for rules that block/unblock matches, it is not desirable for these rules to have side effects that impact else where. Example 2. New RuleContext methods void blockMatch(Match match); void unblockAllMatches(Match match); void cancelMatch(Match match); Here is a basic example that will block all matches from rules that have metadata @department('sales'). They will stay blocked until the blockerAllSalesRules rule becomes false, i.e. \"go2\" is retracted. Example 3. Block rules based on rule metadata rule \"rule1\" @Eager @department('sales') when $s: String(this == 'go1') then System.out.println(\"rule1 fired!\"); end rule \"rule2\" @Eager @department('sales') when $s: String(this == 'go1') then System.out.println(\"rule2 fired!\"); end rule \"blockerAllSalesRules\" @Direct @Eager when $s: String(this == 'go2') $i: Match(department == 'sales') then kcontext.blockMatch($i); end It is necessary to annotate all the rules that could be potentially blocked by rule with @Direct annotation with the annotation @Eager. This is because the potentially blocked rules must be evaluated immediately, so they produce Match instances, that can be evaluated by the blocking rule. This example shows how you can use a property to count the number of active or inactive (already fired) matches. Example 4. Count the number of active/inactive Matches rule \"rule1\" @Eager @department('sales') when $s: String(this == 'go1') then System.out.println(\"rule1 fired!\"); end rule \"rule2\" @Eager @department('sales') when $s: String(this == 'go1') then System.out.println(\"rule2 fired!\"); end rule \"rule3\" @Eager @department('sales') when $s: String(this == 'go1') then System.out.println(\"rule3 fired!\"); end rule \"countActivateInActive\" @Direct @Eager when $s: String(this == 'go2') $active: Number(this == 1) from accumulate( $a: Match(department == 'sales', active == true), count($a)) $inActive: Number(this == 2) from accumulate( $a : Match(department == 'sales', active == false), count($a)) then kcontext.halt(); end The same fact may have multiple dynamic types which do not fit naturally in a class hierarchy. Traits allow to model this very common scenario. A trait is a type that can be applied to (and eventually removed from) an individual object at runtime. To create a trait rather than a traditional bean, one has to declare it explicitly as in the following example: declare trait GoldenCustomer // fields will map to getters/setters code : String balance : long discount : int maxExpense : long end At runtime, this declaration results in an interface, which can be used to write patterns, but can not be instantiated directly. In order to apply a trait to an object, we provide the new don keyword, which can be used as simply as this: when $c : Customer() then GoldenCustomer gc = don( $c, GoldenCustomer.class ); end When a trait is applied to a fact, a proxy class is created on the fly (one such class will be generated lazily for each fact/trait class combination). The proxy instance, which wraps the fact and implements the trait interface, is inserted automatically and will possibly activate other rules. An immediate advantage of declaring and using interfaces and getting the implementation proxy is that multiple inheritance hierarchies can be exploited when writing rules. The fact declarations, however, need not implement any of those interfaces statically. To be possible to assign a trait to a fact, the fact type definition must contain the annotation @Traitable. import org.drools.base.factmodel.traits.Traitable; declare Customer @Traitable code: String balance: long end The only connection between fact classes and trait interfaces is at the proxy level: a trait is not specifically tied to a fact class. This means that the same trait can be applied to totally different facts. For this reason, the trait does not transparently expose the fields of its fact object. So, when writing a rule using a trait interface, only the fields of the interface will be available, as usual. However, any field in the interface that corresponds to a fact field, will be mapped by the proxy class: when $o: OrderItem($p: price, $code: custCode) $c: GoldenCustomer(code == $code,$a : balance,$d: discount) then $c.setBalance($a - $p*$d); end In this case, the code and balance would be read from the underlying Customer object. Likewise, the setAccount will modify the underlying object, preserving a strongly typed access to the data structures. A hard field is a field that must have the same name and type both in the fact class and all trait interfaces. The name is used to establish the mapping: if two fields have the same name, then they must also have the same declared type. The annotation @org.drools.base.factmodel.traits.Alias allows to relax this restriction. If an @Alias is provided, its value string will be used to resolve mappings instead of the original field name. @Alias can be applied both to traits and core beans. import org.drools.base.factmodel.traits.*; declare trait GoldenCustomer balance: long @Alias(\"org.acme.foo.accountBalance\") end declare Person @Traitable name: String savings: long @Alias(\"org.acme.foo.accountBalance\") end when GoldenCustomer(balance > 1000) // will react to new Person(2000) then end More work is being done on relaxing this constraint (see the experimental section on \"logical\" traits later). Now, one might wonder what happens when a fact class does NOT provide the implementation for a field defined in an interface. We call hard fields those trait fields which are also fact fields and thus readily available, while we define soft those fields which are NOT provided by the fact class. Hidden fields, instead, are fields in the fact class not exposed by the interface. So, while hard field management is intuitive, there remains the problem of soft and hidden fields. Hidden fields are normally only accessible using the fact class directly. However, one can also use the \"fields\" Map on a trait interface to access a hidden field. If the field can’t be resolved, null will be returned. Notice that this feature is likely to change in the future. when $sc: GoldenCustomer(fields[\"age\"] > 18) // age is declared by the underlying fact class, but not by GoldenCustomer then Soft fields, instead, are stored in a Map-like data structure that is specific to each fact object and referenced by the proxy(es), so that they are effectively shared even when an object has multiple traits assigned. when $sc: GoldenCustomer($c: code, // hard getter $maxExpense: maxExpense > 1000 // soft getter) then $sc.setDiscount(...); // soft setter end A fact object also holds a reference to all its proxies, so that it is possible to track which traits have been added to an object, using a sort of dynamic \"instanceof\" operator, which we named isA. The operator can accept a String, a class literal or a list of class literals. In the latter case, the constraint is satisfied only if all the specified traits have been assigned. $sc: GoldenCustomer($maxExpense: maxExpense > 1000, this isA \"SeniorCustomer\", this isA [NationalCustomer.class, OnlineCustomer.class]) Eventually, the business logic may require that a trait is removed from a fact object. For this, we provide two options. The first is a \"logical don\", which will result in a logical insertion of the proxy resulting from the trait assignment. The Truth Maintenance System will ensure that the trait is removed when its logical support is removed. then don($x, // core object Customer.class, // trait class true // optional flag for logical insertion) The second option is the use of the shed keyword, which causes the removal of any type that is a subtype (or equivalent) of the one passed as an argument. then Thing t = shed($x, GoldenCustomer.class) This operation returns another proxy implementing the org.drools.base.factmodel.traits.Thing interface, where the getFields() and getCore() methods are defined. Internally, in fact, all declared traits are generated to extend this interface (in addition to any others specified). This allows to preserve the wrapper with the soft fields which would otherwise be lost. A trait and its proxies are also correlated in another way. Whenever a fact object is \"modified\", its proxies are \"modified\" automatically as well, to allow trait-based patterns to react to potential changes in hard fields. Likewise, whenever a trait proxy (matched by a trait pattern) is modified, the modification is propagated to the fact class and the other traits. Moreover, whenever a don operation is performed, the fact object is also modified automatically, to reevaluate any isA operation which may be triggered. Potentially, this may result in a high number of modifications, impacting performance (and correctness) heavily. So two solutions are currently implemented. First, whenever a fact object is modified, only the most specific traits (in the sense of inheritance between trait interfaces) are updated and an internal blocking mechanism is in place to ensure that each potentially matching pattern is evaluated once and only once. So, in the following situation: declare trait GoldenCustomer end declare trait NationalGoldenCustomer extends GoldenCustomer end declare trait SeniorGoldenCustomer extends GoldenCustomer end A modification of an object that is both a GoldenCustomer, a NationalGoldenCustomer and a SeniorGoldenCustomer would cause only the latter two proxies to be actually modified. The first would match any pattern for GoldenCustomer and NationalGoldenCustomer, the latter would instead be prevented from rematching GoldenCustomer, but would be allowed to match SeniorGoldenCustomer patterns. It is not necessary, instead, to modify the GoldenCustomer proxy since it is already covered by at least one other more specific trait. The second method, up to the user, is to mark traits as @PropertyReactive. Property reactivity is trait-enabled and takes into account the trait field mappings, so to block unnecessary propagations. WARNING : This feature is extremely experimental and subject to changes. Normally, a hard field must be exposed with its original type by all traits assigned to an object, to prevent situations such as declare Person @Traitable name: String id: String end declare trait Customer id: String end declare trait Patient id: long // Person can't don Patient, or an exception will be thrown end Should a Person get assigned both Customer and Patient traits, the type of the hard field id would be ambiguous. However, consider the following example, where GoldenCustomers refer their best friends so that they become Customers as well: declare Person @Traitable(logical = true) bestFriend: Person end declare trait Customer end declare trait GoldenCustomer extends Customer refers: Customer @Alias(\"bestFriend\") end Aside from the @Alias, a Person-as-GoldenCustomer’s best friend may be compatible with the requirements of the trait GoldenCustomer, provided that they are some kind of Customer themselves. Marking a Person as \"logically traitable\" - i.e. adding the annotation @Traitable(logical = true) - will instruct the Drools rule engine to try and preserve the logical consistency rather than throwing an exception due to a hard field with different type declarations (Person vs Customer). The following operations would then work: Person p1 = new Person(); Person p2 = new Person(); p1.setBestFriend(p2); ... Customer c2 = don(p2, Customer.class); ... GoldenCustomer gc1 = don(p1, GoldenCustomer.class); ... p1.getBestFriend(); // returns p2 gc1.getRefers(); // returns c2, a Customer proxy wrapping p2 Notice that, by the time p1 becomes GoldenCustomer, p2 must have already become a Customer themselves, otherwise a runtime exception will be thrown since the very definition of GoldenCustomer would have been violated. In some cases, however, one may want to infer, rather than verify, that p2 is a Customer by virtue that p1 is a GoldenCustomer. This modality can be enabled by marking Customer as \"logical\", using the annotation @org.drools.base.factmodel.traits.Trait(logical = true). In this case, should p2 not be a Customer by the time that p1 becomes a GoldenCustomer, it will be automatically assigned the trait Customer to preserve the logical integrity of the system. Notice that the annotation on the fact class enables the dynamic type management for its fields, whereas the annotation on the traits determines whether they will be enforced as integrity constraints or cascaded dynamically. import org.drools.factmodel.traits.*; declare trait Customer @Trait(logical = true) end The impact analysis feature analyzes the relationships between the rules and generates a graph. When you specify a rule to be changed, the impact analysis feature analyzes the rules that are impacted by the change and renders the rules in the generated graph. The generated graph supports DOT, SVG, and PNG formats with simple text output. You can find an example usage in ExampleUsageTest.java under drools-impact-analysis/drools-impact-analysis-itests Configure the following dependency. org.drools drools-impact-analysis-graph-graphviz ${drools.version} Create a KieFileSystem to store your assets and call KieBuilder.buildAll(ImpactAnalysisProject.class) method. // set up KieFileSystem ... KieBuilder kieBuilder = KieServices.Factory.get().newKieBuilder(kfs).buildAll(ImpactAnalysisProject.class); ImpactAnalysisKieModule analysisKieModule = (ImpactAnalysisKieModule) kieBuilder.getKieModule(); AnalysisModel analysisModel = analysisKieModule.getAnalysisModel(); You get AnalysisModel. Convert the AnalysisModel to Graph using ModelToGraphConverter. ModelToGraphConverter converter = new ModelToGraphConverter(); Graph graph = converter.toGraph(analysisModel); Specify a rule that you plan to change. The ImpactAnalysisHelper generates a graph, containing the changed rule and the impacted rules. ImpactAnalysisHelper impactFilter = new ImpactAnalysisHelper(); Graph impactedSubGraph = impactFilter.filterImpactedNodes(graph, \"org.drools.impact.analysis.example.PriceCheck_11\"); Generate a graph image using GraphImageGenerator. You can choose the format from DOT, SVG, and PNG. GraphImageGenerator generator = new GraphImageGenerator(\"example-impacted-sub-graph\"); generator.generateSvg(impactedSubGraph); Simple text output is also available using TextReporter. You can choose the format from HierarchyText and FlatText. String hierarchyText = TextReporter.toHierarchyText(impactedSubGraph); System.out.println(hierarchyText); In a generated graph, red node represents a changed rule and yellow nodes represent the impacted rules. A solid arrow in a generated graph indicates a positive impact, in which the source rule activates the target rule. However, a dashed arrow indicates a negative impact, in which the source rule deactivates the target rule. Also, a dotted arrow represents an unknown impact, in which the source rule might activate or deactivate the target rule. You can collapse a graph based on the rule name prefix or RuleSet in a spreadsheet using the GraphCollapsionHelper. This enables you to view the overview of a graph. Also, you can use ImpactAnalysisHelper to the collapsed graph. Graph collapsedGraph = new GraphCollapsionHelper().collapseWithRuleNamePrefix(graph); Graph impactedCollapsedSubGraph = impactFilter.filterImpactedNodes(collapsedGraph, \"org.drools.impact.analysis.example.PriceCheck\"); If you only want to view the positive relations in a graph, set the positiveOnly to true for ModelToGraphConverter, ImpactAnalysisHelper, and GraphCollapsionHelper constructor. ModelToGraphConverter converter = new ModelToGraphConverter(true); Graph graph = converter.toGraph(analysisModel); ImpactAnalysisHelper impactFilter = new ImpactAnalysisHelper(true); Graph impactedSubGraph = impactFilter.filterImpactedNodes(graph, \"org.drools.impact.analysis.example.PriceCheck_11\"); Text output is useful for a large number of rules. In a text output, [*] represents a changed rule, and [+] represents impacted rules. --- toHierarchyText --- Inventory shortage[+] PriceCheck_11[*] StatusCheck_12[+] (Inventory shortage) StatusCheck_13[+] StatusCheck_11[+] (PriceCheck_11) --- toFlatText --- Inventory shortage[+] PriceCheck_11[*] StatusCheck_11[+] StatusCheck_12[+] StatusCheck_13[+] If you get the warning message when rendering SVG or PNG: graphviz-java failed to render an image. Solutions would be: 1. Install graphviz tools in your local machine. graphviz-java will use graphviz command line binary (e.g. /usr/bin/dot) if available. 2. Consider generating a graph in DOT format and then visualize it with an external tool. You would need to install graphviz tools in your local machine. If not possible, you would need to generate the graph in DOT format so that you can render it with another tool later on.","title":"Experimental features","component":"drools","version":"","name":"index","url":"/drools/experimental-features/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Declarative agenda","hash":"experimental-declarative-agenda_experimental-features","id":1},{"text":"Traits","hash":"experimental-traits_experimental-features","id":2},{"text":"Cascading traits","hash":"_cascading_traits","id":3},{"text":"Impact analysis","hash":"experimental-impact-analysis_experimental-features","id":4},{"text":"Using the impact analysis feature","hash":"_using_the_impact_analysis_feature","id":5},{"text":"Troubleshooting","hash":"_troubleshooting","id":6}]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"This guide walks you through the process of creating a simple Drools application project.

As a business rules developer, you can use Drools to design a variety of decision services. This document describes how to create and test an example traffic violation project based on the Traffic_Violation sample project available from the Kogito Examples GitHub repository. This sample project uses a Decision Model and Notation (DMN) model to define driver penalty and suspension rules in a traffic violation decision service. You can follow the steps in this document to create the project and the assets it contains, or open and review the existing Traffic_Violation sample project. Alternatively, you may directly skip to the project evaluation by checking out locally the ready-made Traffic_Violation sample project from the link above, and jumping to the Evaluating the traffic violations DMN model with Drools section. For more information about the DMN components and implementation in Drools, see DMN Engine in Drools section. Prerequisites Having identified the target deployment platform, such as using Drools as an embedded Java library or Kogito for cloud-native platform Having satisfied prerequisites of the target deployment platform Considering deployment procedures of the target deployment platform while following this tutorial For this example, create a new project called traffic-violation in your IDE. A project is a container for assets such as data objects, DMN assets, and test scenarios. This example project that you are creating is similar to the existing Traffic_Violation sample project. Procedure Follow the instruction depending on your IDE to create a new KJAR based Maven project. Decision Model and Notation (DMN) is a standard established by the Object Management Group (OMG) for describing and modeling operational decisions. DMN defines an XML schema that enables DMN models to be shared between DMN-compliant platforms and across organizations so that business analysts and business rules developers can collaborate in designing and implementing DMN decision services. The DMN standard is similar to and can be used together with the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard for designing and modeling business processes. For general information about the background and applications of DMN, see the Drools DMN landing page. A decision requirements diagram (DRD) is a visual representation of your DMN model. Use the KIE DMN Editor to design the DRD for the traffic violations project and to define the decision logic of the DRD components. Figure 1. DRD for the Traffic Violations example Prerequisites You have created the traffic violations project in Drools. Procedure On the traffic-violation project’s home page, click Add Asset. On the Add Asset page, click DMN. The Create new DMN window is opened. In the Create new DMN window, enter Traffic Violation in the DMN name field. From the Package list, select com.myspace.traffic_violation. Click Ok. The DMN asset in the DMN designer is opened. In the DMN designer canvas, drag two DMN Input Data input nodes onto the canvas. Figure 2. DMN Input Data nodes In the upper-right corner, click the icon. Double-click the input nodes and rename one to Driver and the other to Violation. Drag a DMN Decision decision node onto the canvas. Double-click the decision node and rename it to Fine. Click the Violation input node, select the Create DMN Information Requirement icon and click the Fine decision node to link the two nodes. Figure 3. Create DMN Information Requirement icon Drag a DMN Decision decision node onto the canvas. Double-click the decision node and rename it to Should the driver be suspended?. Click the Driver input node, select the Create DMN Information Requirement icon and click the Should the driver be suspended? decision node to link the two nodes. Click the Fine decision node, select the Create DMN Information Requirement icon, and select the Should the driver be suspended? decision node. Click Save. As you periodically save a DRD, the DMN designer performs a static validation of the DMN model and might produce error messages until the model is defined completely. After you finish defining the DMN model completely, if any errors remain, troubleshoot the specified problems accordingly. DMN data types determine the structure of the data that you use within a table, column, or field in a DMN boxed expression for defining decision logic. You can use default DMN data types (such as string, number, or boolean) or you can create custom data types to specify additional fields and constraints that you want to implement for the boxed expression values. Use the KIE DMN Editor’s Data Types tab to define the custom data types for the traffic violations project. Figure 4. The custom data types tab The following tables list the tDriver, tViolation, and tFine custom data types that you will create for this project. Table 1. tDriver custom data type Name Type tDriver Structure Name string Age number State string City string Points number Table 2. tViolation custom data type Name Type tViolation Structure Code string Date date Type string Speed Limit number Actual Speed number Table 3. tFine custom data type Name Type tFine Structure Amount number Points number Prerequisites You created the traffic violations DMN decision requirements diagram (DRDs) using KIE DMN Editor.

Enter the following values in the fourth row of the decision table: Violation.Type: \"driving under the influence\" Violation.Actual Speed - Violation.Speed Limit: - Amount: 1000 Points: 5 Click Save. To define the driver suspension rule, return to the DMN designer canvas, select the Should the driver be suspended? decision node, and click the Edit icon to open the DMN boxed expression designer. Click Select expression → Context. Click ContextEntry-1, enter Total Points as the Name, and select number from the Data Type drop-down menu. Click the cell next to Total Points, select Literal expression from the context menu, and enter Driver.Points + Fine.Points as the expression. In the cell below Driver.Points + Fine.Points, select Literal Expression from the context menu, and enter if Total Points >= 20 then \"Yes\" else \"No\". Click Save. You have defined how to calculate the fine and the context for deciding when to suspend the driver. You can navigate to the traffic-violation project page and click Build to build the example project and address any errors noted in the Alerts panel. Test scenarios in Drools enable you to validate the functionality of business rules and business rule data (for rules-based test scenarios) or of DMN models (for DMN-based test scenarios) before deploying them into a production environment. With a test scenario, you use data from your project to set given conditions and expected results based on one or more defined business rules. When you run the scenario, the expected results and actual results of the rule instance are compared. If the expected results match the actual results, the test is successful. If the expected results do not match the actual results, then the test fails. You can run the defined test scenarios in a number of ways, for example, you can run available test scenarios at the project level or inside a specific test scenario asset. Test scenarios are independent and cannot affect or modify other test scenarios. You can run test scenarios at any time during project development in Drools. You can import data objects from different packages to the same project package as the test scenario. Assets in the same package are imported by default. After you create the necessary data objects and the test scenario, you can use the Data Objects tab of the test scenarios designer to verify that all required data objects are listed or to import other existing data objects by adding a New item. Use the test scenarios designer to test the DMN decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) and define decision logic for the traffic violations project. Figure 12.

The archetype also contain more advanced test cases, using the SceSim tool. The following examples assumes Kogito is the chosen target deployment platform. The source code and detailed runtime instructions for the Traffic_Violation sample project are readily made available for Kogito from the Kogito Examples GitHub repository. Procedure Determine the base URL for accessing the REST API endpoints. This requires knowing the following values (with the default local deployment values as an example): Host (localhost) Port (8080) REST path (none specific) Example base URL in local deployment for the traffic violations project: http://localhost:8080/Traffic Violation Determine user authentication requirements. If users and roles are configured on the Kogito on Quarkus application, HTTP Basic authentication may be required with user name and password. Successful requests require that the user have the configured role. The following example demonstrates how to add credentials to a curl request: curl -u username:password If the Kogito on Quarkus application is configured with Red Hat Single Sign-On, the request must include a bearer token: curl -H \"Authorization: bearer $TOKEN\" Execute the DMN model: [POST] Traffic%20Violation Example curl request: curl -L -X POST 'localhost:8080/Traffic Violation' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Accept: application/json' \\ --data-raw '{ \"Driver\": { \"Points\": 2 }, \"Violation\": { \"Type\": \"speed\", \"Actual Speed\": 120, \"Speed Limit\": 100 } }' Example JSON request: { \"Driver\": { \"Points\": 2 }, \"Violation\": { \"Type\": \"speed\", \"Actual Speed\": 120, \"Speed Limit\": 100 } } Example JSON response: { \"Driver\": { \"Points\": 2 }, \"Violation\": { \"Type\": \"speed\", \"Actual Speed\": 120, \"Speed Limit\": 100 }, \"Fine\": { \"Points\": 3, \"Amount\": 500 }, \"Should the driver be suspended?\": \"No\" }","title":"Getting Started","component":"drools","version":"","name":"index","url":"/drools/getting-started/index.html","titles":[{"text":"First Rule Project","hash":"first-rule-project_getting-started","id":1},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":2},{"text":"Creating a project with maven archetype","hash":"_creating_a_project_with_maven_archetype","id":3},{"text":"Rule Unit style","hash":"_rule_unit_style","id":4},{"text":"Traditional style","hash":"_traditional_style","id":5},{"text":"Getting started with decision services in Drools","hash":"assembly-getting-started-decision-services","id":6},{"text":"Creating the traffic violations project from scratch","hash":"dmn-gs-new-project-creating-proc_getting-started-decision-services","id":7},{"text":"Decision Model and Notation (DMN)","hash":"dmn_getting-started-decision-services","id":8},{"text":"Creating the traffic violations DMN decision requirements diagram (DRD)","hash":"dmn-gs-creating-drd-proc","id":9},{"text":"Creating the traffic violations DMN custom data types","hash":"dmn-gs-creating-custom-datatypes-proc","id":10},{"text":"Assigning custom data types to the DRD input and decision nodes","hash":"dmn-gs-assigning-custom-datatypes-proc","id":11},{"text":"Defining the traffic violations DMN decision logic","hash":"dmn-gs-defining-decision-logic-proc","id":12},{"text":"Test scenarios","hash":"test-scenarios-intro-con_getting-started-decision-services","id":13},{"text":"Testing the traffic violations using test scenarios","hash":"dmn-gs-testing-test-scenario-proc","id":14},{"text":"Evaluating the traffic violations DMN model with Drools","hash":"gs-evaluating-dmn_getting-started-decision-services","id":15},{"text":"Example: Drools DMN engine as an embedded library use","hash":"evaluating-dmn-example-archetype_getting-started-decision-services","id":16},{"text":"Example: Kogito as the target deployment platform","hash":"evaluating-dmn-example-kogito_getting-started-decision-services","id":17}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"Drools is a set of projects focusing on intelligent automation and decision management, most notably providing a forward-chaining and backward-chaining inference-based rule engine, DMN decisions engine and other projects.

You define DRL rules in .drl text files. A DRL file can contain one or more rules that define at a minimum the rule conditions (when) and actions (then). DRL files consist of the following components: Components in a DRL file package unit import declare // Optional query // Optional rule \"rule name\" // Attributes when // Conditions then // Actions end rule \"rule2 name\" ... The following example DRL rule determines the age limit in a loan application decision service: Example rule for loan application age limit rule \"Underage\" when /applicants[ applicantName : name, age end rule \"Using a rule unit with a declared type\" when $p : /persons[ name == \"James\" ] then // Insert Mark, who is a customer of James. Person mark = new Person(); mark.setName( \"Mark\" ); persons.append( mark ); end If you declare a rule unit in DRL, the rule unit class will be generated by Drools at build time. It means that you can’t refer to the class in your client codes. Declared rule units are only useful when the client is also auto-generated, for example, REST endpoint generation by Drools-Quarkus integration. To separate the fact types from the rule unit for use with other DRL rules, you can declare the types in a separate DRL file and then use the DRL rule file to declare the data sources by using the RuleUnitData interface implementation: Example DRL type declaration as a separate file package org.mortgages; declare Person name : String dateOfBirth : Date address : Address end Example DRL rule unit file without explicitly defined types package org.mortgages; unit MortgageRules; import org.drools.ruleunits.api.RuleUnitData; import org.drools.ruleunits.api.DataStream; declare MortgageRules extends RuleUnitData persons: DataStream end rule \"Using a rule unit with a declared type\" when $p : /persons[ name == \"James\" ] then // Insert Mark, who is a customer of James. Person mark = new Person(); mark.setName( \"Mark\" ); persons.append( mark ); end In this example, persons is a DataStream data source for facts of type Person. Data sources are typed sources of data that rule units can subscribe to for updates. You interact with the rule unit through the data sources it exposes. A data source can be a DataStream source for append-only storage, a DataStore source for writable storage to add or remove data, or a SingletonStore source for writable storage to set and clear a single element. As part of your data source declaration, you also import org.drools.ruleunits.api.RuleUnitData and the relevant data source support, such as import org.drools.ruleunits.api.DataStream in this example. You can add several rules to the same DRL file, or further break down the rule set and type declarations by creating more files. However you construct your rule sets, ensure that all DRL rule files exist in the same directory and start with the correct package and unit declarations. As an additional rule unit use case, consider the following example decision service that evaluates incoming data from a heat sensor for temperature measurements and produces alerts when the temperature is above a specified threshold. This example service uses the following types.drl file in the src/main/resources/org/acme folder of the Drools project to declare the Temperature and the Alert fact types: Example DRL type declarations package com.acme; declare Temperature value: double end declare Alert severity: String message: String end To define DRL rules that pattern-match against Temperature values, the example service must expose an entry point for the incoming data to the Drools rule engine and publish alerts on a separate channel. To establish this data source for decision data, the example service uses a rule unit with DataStream data sources for Temperature objects and for Alert objects. The DataStream data source is an append-only store for incoming data, similar to a queue. This type of data source is logical for both sources in this example because the temperature data is coming from an external source (the sensor) and the service publishes the alerts externally as they are produced. The example service uses the following MonitoringService.drl file in the same src/main/resources/com/acme folder of the Drools project to declare the data sources for the fact types and defines the rules for the rule unit: Example DRL rule unit file package com.acme; unit MonitoringService; import org.drools.ruleunits.api.RuleUnitData; import org.drools.ruleunits.api.DataStream; declare MonitoringService extends RuleUnitData temperatures: DataStream alertData: DataStream end rule \"tooHot\" when $temp : /temperatures[value >= 80] then alertData.append(new Alert(\"HIGH\", \"Temperature exceeds threshold: \" + temp.value)); end The rule unit implements the required RuleUnitData interface and declares the data sources for the previously defined types. The sample rule raises an alert when the temperature reaches or exceeds 80 degrees. Figure 2. Import Similar to import statements in Java, imports in DRL files identify the fully qualified paths and type names for any objects that you want to use in the rules. You specify the package and data object in the format packageName.objectName, with multiple imports on separate lines. The Drools rule engine automatically imports classes from the Java package with the same name as the DRL package and from the package java.lang. The following example is an import statement for a loan application object in a mortgage application decision service: Example import statement in a DRL file import org.mortgages.LoanApplication; Figure 3. Type declaration Figure 4. Metadata Declarations in DRL files define new fact types or metadata for fact types to be used by rules in the DRL file: New fact types: The default fact type in the java.lang package of Drools is Object, but you can declare other types in DRL files as needed. Declaring fact types in DRL files enables you to define a new fact model directly in the Drools rule engine, without creating models in a lower-level language like Java. You can also declare a new type when a domain model is already built and you want to complement this model with additional entities that are used mainly during the reasoning process. Metadata for fact types: You can associate metadata in the format @KEY( VALUE ) with new or existing facts. Metadata can be any kind of data that is not represented by the fact attributes and is consistent among all instances of that fact type. The metadata can be queried at run time by the Drools rule engine and used in the reasoning process. A declaration of a new fact does not require any metadata, but must include a list of attributes or fields. If a type declaration does not include identifying attributes, the Drools rule engine searches for an existing fact class in the classpath and raises an error if the class is missing. For example, the following DRL file contains a declaration of a new fact type Person from a persons data source and uses no metadata: Example declaration of a new fact type with a rule declare Person name : String dateOfBirth : java.util.Date address : Address end rule \"Using a declared type\" when $p : /persons[ name == \"James\" ] then // Insert Mark, who is a customer of James. Person mark = new Person(); mark.setName( \"Mark\" ); persons.append( mark ); end In this example, the new fact type Person has the three attributes name, dateOfBirth, and address. Each attribute has a type that can be any valid Java type, including another class that you create or a fact type that you previously declared. The dateOfBirth attribute has the type java.util.Date, from the Java API, and the address attribute has the previously defined fact type Address. To avoid writing the fully qualified name of a class every time you declare it, you can define the full class name as part of the import clause: Example type declaration with the fully qualified class name in the import import java.util.Date declare Person name : String dateOfBirth : Date address : Address end When you declare a new fact type, the Drools rule engine generates at compile time a Java class representing the fact type. The generated Java class is a one-to-one JavaBeans mapping of the type definition. For example, the following Java class is generated from the example Person type declaration: Generated Java class for the Person fact type declaration public class Person implements Serializable { private String name; private java.util.Date dateOfBirth; private Address address; // Empty constructor public Person() {...} // Constructor with all fields public Person( String name, Date dateOfBirth, Address address ) {...} // If keys are defined, constructor with keys public Person( ...keys... ) {...} // Getters and setters // `equals` and `hashCode` // `toString` } You can then use the generated class in your rules like any other fact, as illustrated in the previous rule example with the Person type declaration from a persons data source: Example rule that uses the declared Person fact type rule \"Using a declared type\" when $p : /persons[ name == \"James\" ] then // Insert Mark, who is a customer of James. Person mark = new Person(); mark.setName( \"Mark\" ); persons.append( mark ); end DRL supports the declaration of enumerative types in the format declare enum FACT_TYPE, followed by a comma-separated list of values ending with a semicolon. You can then use the enumerative list in the rules in the DRL file. For example, the following enumerative type declaration defines days of the week for an employee scheduling rule: Example enumerative type declaration with a scheduling rule declare enum DaysOfWeek SUN(\"Sunday\"),MON(\"Monday\"),TUE(\"Tuesday\"),WED(\"Wednesday\"),THU(\"Thursday\"),FRI(\"Friday\"),SAT(\"Saturday\"); fullName : String end rule \"Using a declared Enum\" when $emp : /employees[ dayOff == DaysOfWeek.MON ] then ... end DRL supports type declaration inheritance in the format declare FACT_TYPE_1 extends FACT_TYPE_2. To extend a type declared in Java by a subtype declared in DRL, you repeat the parent type in a declaration statement without any fields. For example, the following type declarations extend a Student type from a top-level Person type, and a LongTermStudent type from the Student subtype: Example extended type declarations import org.people.Person declare Person end declare Student extends Person school : String end declare LongTermStudent extends Student years : int course : String end You can associate metadata in the format @KEY( VALUE ) (the value is optional) with fact types or fact attributes. Metadata can be any kind of data that is not represented by the fact attributes and is consistent among all instances of that fact type. The metadata can be queried at run time by the Drools rule engine and used in the reasoning process. Any metadata that you declare before the attributes of a fact type are assigned to the fact type, while metadata that you declare after an attribute are assigned to that particular attribute. In the following example, the two metadata attributes @author and @dateOfCreation are declared for the Person fact type, and the two metadata items @key (literal) and @maxLength are declared for the name attribute. The @key literal metadata attribute has no required value, so the parentheses and the value are omitted. Example metadata declaration for fact types and attributes import java.util.Date declare Person @author( Bob ) @dateOfCreation( 01-Feb-2009 ) name : String @key @maxLength( 30 ) dateOfBirth : Date address : Address end For declarations of metadata attributes for existing types, you can identify the fully qualified class name as part of the import clause for all declarations or as part of the individual declare clause: Example metadata declaration for an imported type import org.drools.examples.Person declare Person @author( Bob ) @dateOfCreation( 01-Feb-2009 ) end Example metadata declaration for a declared type declare org.drools.examples.Person @author( Bob ) @dateOfCreation( 01-Feb-2009 ) end Although you can define custom metadata attributes in DRL declarations, the Drools rule engine also supports the following predefined metadata tags for declarations of fact types or fact type attributes. The examples in this section that refer to the VoiceCall class assume that the sample application domain model includes the following class details: VoiceCall fact class in an example Telecom domain model public class VoiceCall { private String originNumber; private String destinationNumber; private Date callDateTime; private long callDuration; // in milliseconds // Constructors, getters, and setters } @role This tag determines whether a given fact type is handled as a regular fact or an event in the Drools rule engine during complex event processing. Default parameter: fact Supported parameters: fact, event @role( fact | event ) Example: Declare VoiceCall as event type declare VoiceCall @role( event ) end @timestamp This tag is automatically assigned to every event in the Drools rule engine. By default, the time is provided by the session clock and assigned to the event when it is inserted into the working memory of the Drools rule engine. You can specify a custom time stamp attribute instead of the default time stamp added by the session clock. Default parameter: The time added by the Drools rule engine session clock Supported parameters: Session clock time or custom time stamp attribute @timestamp( ATTRIBUTE_NAME ) Example: Declare VoiceCall timestamp attribute declare VoiceCall @role( event ) @timestamp( callDateTime ) end @duration This tag determines the duration time for events in the Drools rule engine. Events can be interval-based events or point-in-time events. Interval-based events have a duration time and persist in the working memory of the Drools rule engine until their duration time has lapsed. Point-in-time events have no duration and are essentially interval-based events with a duration of zero. By default, every event in the Drools rule engine has a duration of zero. You can specify a custom duration attribute instead of the default. Default parameter: Null (zero) Supported parameters: Custom duration attribute @duration( ATTRIBUTE_NAME ) Example: Declare VoiceCall duration attribute declare VoiceCall @role( event ) @timestamp( callDateTime ) @duration( callDuration ) end @expires This tag determines the time duration before an event expires in the working memory of the Drools rule engine. By default, an event expires when the event can no longer match and activate any of the current rules. You can define an amount of time after which an event should expire. This tag definition also overrides the implicit expiration offset calculated from temporal constraints and sliding windows in the KIE base. This tag is available only when the Drools rule engine is running in stream mode. Default parameter: Null (event expires after event can no longer match and activate rules) Supported parameters: Custom timeOffset attribute in the format [#d][#h][#m][#s][#ms] @expires( TIME_OFFSET ) Example: Declare expiration offset for VoiceCall events declare VoiceCall @role( event ) @timestamp( callDateTime ) @duration( callDuration ) @expires( 1h35m ) end @typesafe This tab determines whether a given fact type is compiled with or without type safety. By default, all type declarations are compiled with type safety enabled. You can override this behavior to type-unsafe evaluation, where all constraints are generated as MVEL constraints and executed dynamically. This is useful when dealing with collections that do not have any generics or mixed type collections. Default parameter: true Supported parameters: true, false @typesafe( BOOLEAN ) Example: Declare VoiceCall for type-unsafe evaluation declare VoiceCall @role( fact ) @typesafe( false ) end @serialVersionUID This tag defines an identifying serialVersionUID value for a serializable class in a fact declaration. If a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialVersionUID, the serialization run time calculates a default serialVersionUID value for that class based on various aspects of the class, as described in the Java Object Serialization Specification. However, for optimal deserialization results and for greater compatibility with serialized KIE sessions, set the serialVersionUID as needed in the relevant class or in your DRL declarations. Default parameter: Null Supported parameters: Custom serialVersionUID integer @serialVersionUID( INTEGER ) Example: Declare serialVersionUID for a VoiceCall class declare VoiceCall @serialVersionUID( 42 ) end @key This tag enables a fact type attribute to be used as a key identifier for the fact type. The generated class can then implement the equals() and hashCode() methods to determine if two instances of the type are equal to each other. The Drools rule engine can also generate a constructor using all the key attributes as parameters. Default parameter: None Supported parameters: None ATTRIBUTE_DEFINITION @key Example: Declare Person type attributes as keys declare Person firstName : String @key lastName : String @key age : int end For this example, the Drools rule engine checks the firstName and lastName attributes to determine if two instances of Person are equal to each other, but it does not check the age attribute. The Drools rule engine also implicitly generates three constructors: one without parameters, one with the @key fields, and one with all fields: Example constructors from the key declarations Person() // Empty constructor Person( String firstName, String lastName ) Person( String firstName, String lastName, int age ) You can then create instances of the type based on the key constructors, as shown in the following example: Example instance using the key constructor Person person = new Person( \"John\", \"Doe\" ); Figure 5. Query Queries in DRL files search the working memory of the Drools rule engine for facts related to the rules in the DRL file. You add the query definitions in DRL files and then obtain the matching results in your application code. Queries search for a set of defined conditions and do not require when or then specifications. Query names are scoped to the rule unit, so each query name must be unique within the same rule unit. In Drools, queries are automatically exposed as REST endpoints. The following example is a query definition for an Alert object with a severity field set to HIGH: Example query definition in a DRL file package com.acme; unit MonitoringService; query highSeverity alerts : /alertData[ severity == \"HIGH\" ] end Drools automatically exposes this query through an endpoint /high-severity. For this example, assume that the MonitoringService rule unit class has the following form: Example Java rule unit class package com.acme; import org.drools.ruleunits.api.DataSource; import org.drools.ruleunits.api.DataStream; public class MonitoringService implements RuleUnitData { private DataStream temperature = DataSource.createStream(); private DataStream alertData = DataSource.createStream(); public DataStream getTemperature() { return temperature; } public DataStream getAlertData() { return alertData; } } In this case, you can invoke the query using the following command: Example POST request to the /high-severity endpoint $ curl -X POST \\ -H 'Accept: application/json' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{ \"eventData\": [ { \"type\": \"temperature\", \"value\" : 20 }, { \"type\": \"temperature\", \"value\" : 100 } ] }' \\ http://localhost:8080/high-severity Example response (JSON) { \"alerts\" : [ { \"severity\" : \"HIGH\", \"message\" : \"Temperature exceeds threshold: 100\" } ] } This example submits the data to the eventData data source and returns the result of the highSeverity query as a response. Figure 6. Rule attributes Rule attributes are additional specifications that you can add to business rules to modify rule behavior. In DRL files, you typically define rule attributes above the rule conditions and actions, with multiple attributes on separate lines, in the following format: rule \"rule_name\" // Attribute // Attribute when // Conditions then // Actions end The following table lists the names and supported values of the attributes that you can assign to rules: Table 1. Rule attributes Attribute Value salience An integer defining the priority of the rule. Rules with a higher salience value are given higher priority when ordered in the internalMatch queue. Example: salience 10 enabled A Boolean value. When the option is selected, the rule is enabled. When the option is not selected, the rule is disabled. Example: enabled true date-effective A string containing a date and time definition. The rule can be activated only if the current date and time is after a date-effective attribute. Example: date-effective \"4-Sep-2018\" date-expires A string containing a date and time definition. The rule cannot be activated if the current date and time is after the date-expires attribute. Example: date-expires \"4-Oct-2018\" no-loop A Boolean value. When the option is selected, the rule cannot be reactivated (looped) if a consequence of the rule re-triggers a previously met condition. When the condition is not selected, the rule can be looped in these circumstances. Example: no-loop true activation-group A string identifying an internalMatch (or XOR) group to which you want to assign the rule. In internalMatch groups, only one rule can be activated. The first rule to fire will cancel all pending internalMatches of all rules in the internalMatch group. Example: activation-group \"GroupName\" duration A long integer value defining the duration of time in milliseconds after which the rule can be activated, if the rule conditions are still met. Example: duration 10000 timer A string identifying either int (initialDelay interval) or cron timer definitions for scheduling the rule. Example: timer ( int: 30s 5m ) (every 5 minutes after a 30-second delay) timer ( cron:* 0/15 * * * ? ) (every 15 minutes) calendar A Quartz calendar definition for scheduling the rule. Example: calendars \"* * 0-7,18-23 ? * *\" (exclude non-business hours) auto-focus A Boolean value, applicable only to rules within agenda groups. When the option is selected, the next time the rule is activated, a focus is automatically given to the agenda group to which the rule is assigned. Example: auto-focus true lock-on-active A Boolean value, applicable only to rules within rule flow groups or agenda groups. When the option is selected, the next time the ruleflow group for the rule becomes active or the agenda group for the rule receives a focus, the rule cannot be activated again until the ruleflow group is no longer active or the agenda group loses the focus. This is a stronger version of the no-loop attribute, because the internalMatch of a matching rule is discarded regardless of the origin of the update (not only by the rule itself). This attribute is ideal for calculation rules where you have a number of rules that modify a fact and you do not want any rule re-matching and firing again. Example: lock-on-active true dialect A string identifying either JAVA or MVEL as the language to be used for code expressions in the rule. By default, the rule uses the dialect specified at the package level. Any dialect specified here overrides the package dialect setting for the rule. Example: dialect \"JAVA\" Timers and calendars are DRL rule attributes that enable you to apply scheduling and timing constraints to your DRL rules. These attributes require additional configurations depending on the use case. The timer attribute in DRL rules is a string identifying either int (interval) or cron timer definitions for scheduling a rule and supports the following formats: Timer attribute formats timer ( int: __INITIAL_DELAY__ __REPEAT_INTERVAL__ ) timer ( cron: __CRON_EXPRESSION__ ) Example interval timer attributes // Run after a 30-second delay timer ( int: 30s ) // Run every 5 minutes after a 30-second delay each time timer ( int: 30s 5m ) Example cron timer attribute // Run every 15 minutes timer ( cron:* 0/15 * * * ? ) Interval timers follow the semantics of java.util.Timer objects, with an initial delay and an optional repeat interval. Cron timers follow standard Unix cron expressions. The following example DRL rule uses a cron timer to send an SMS text message every 15 minutes: Example DRL rule with a cron timer rule \"Send SMS message every 15 minutes\" timer ( cron:* 0/15 * * * ? ) when $a : Alarm( on == true ) then channels[ \"sms\" ].insert( new Sms( $a.mobileNumber, \"The alarm is still on.\" ); end Generally, a rule that is controlled by a timer becomes active when the rule is triggered and the rule consequence is executed repeatedly, according to the timer settings. The execution stops when the rule condition no longer matches incoming facts. However, the way the Drools rule engine handles rules with timers depends on whether the Drools rule engine is in active mode or in passive mode. By default, the Drools rule engine runs in passive mode and evaluates rules, according to the defined timer settings, when a user or an application explicitly calls fireAllRules(). Conversely, if a user or application calls fireUntilHalt(), the Drools rule engine starts in active mode and evaluates rules continually until the user or application explicitly calls halt(). When the Drools rule engine is in active mode, rule consequences are executed even after control returns from a call to fireUntilHalt() and the Drools rule engine remains reactive to any changes made to the working memory. For example, removing a fact that was involved in triggering the timer rule execution causes the repeated execution to terminate, and inserting a fact so that some rule matches causes that rule to be executed. However, the Drools rule engine is not continually active, but is active only after a rule is executed. Therefore, the Drools rule engine does not react to asynchronous fact insertions until the next execution of a timer-controlled rule. Disposing a KIE session terminates all timer activity. When the Drools rule engine is in passive mode, rule consequences of timed rules are evaluated only when fireAllRules() is invoked again. However, you can change the default timer-execution behavior in passive mode by configuring the KIE session with a TimedRuleExecutionOption option, as shown in the following example: KIE session configuration to automatically execute timed rules in passive mode KieSessionConfiguration ksconf = KieServices.Factory.get().newKieSessionConfiguration(); ksconf.setOption( TimedRuleExecutionOption.YES ); KSession ksession = kbase.newKieSession(ksconf, null); You can additionally set a FILTERED specification on the TimedRuleExecutionOption option that enables you to define a callback to filter those rules, as shown in the following example: KIE session configuration to filter which timed rules are automatically executed KieSessionConfiguration ksconf = KieServices.Factory.get().newKieSessionConfiguration(); conf.setOption( new TimedRuleExecutionOption.FILTERED(new TimedRuleExecutionFilter() { public boolean accept(Rule[] rules) { return rules[0].getName().equals(\"MyRule\"); } }) ); For interval timers, you can also use an expression timer with expr instead of int to define both the delay and interval as an expression instead of a fixed value. The following example DRL file declares a fact type with a delay and period that are then used in the subsequent rule with an expression timer: Example rule with an expression timer declare Bean delay : String = \"30s\" period : long = 60000 end rule \"Expression timer\" timer ( expr: $d, $p ) when Bean( $d : delay, $p : period ) then // Actions end The expressions, such as $d and $p in this example, can use any variable defined in the pattern-matching part of the rule. The variable can be any String value that can be parsed into a time duration or any numeric value that is internally converted in a long value for a duration in milliseconds. Both interval and expression timers can use the following optional parameters: start and end: A Date or a String representing a Date or a long value. The value can also be a Number that is transformed into a Java Date in the format new Date( ((Number) n).longValue() ). repeat-limit: An integer that defines the maximum number of repetitions allowed by the timer. If both the end and the repeat-limit parameters are set, the timer stops when the first of the two is reached. Example timer attribute with optional start, end, and repeat-limit parameters timer (int: 30s 1h; start=3-JAN-2020, end=4-JAN-2020, repeat-limit=50) In this example, the rule is scheduled for every hour, after a delay of 30 seconds each hour, beginning on 3 January 2020 and ending either on 4 January 2020 or when the cycle repeats 50 times. If the system is paused (for example, the session is serialized and then later deserialized), the rule is scheduled only one time to recover from missing internalMatches regardless of how many internalMatches were missed during the pause, and then the rule is subsequently scheduled again to continue in sync with the timer setting. The calendar attribute in DRL rules is a Quartz calendar definition for scheduling a rule and supports the following format: Calendar attribute format calendars \"DEFINITION_OR_REGISTERED_NAME\" Example calendar attributes // Exclude non-business hours calendars \"* * 0-7,18-23 ? * *\" // Weekdays only, as registered in the KIE session calendars \"weekday\" You can adapt a Quartz calendar based on the Quartz calendar API and then register the calendar in the KIE session, as shown in the following example: Adapting a Quartz Calendar Calendar weekDayCal = QuartzHelper.quartzCalendarAdapter(org.quartz.Calendar quartzCal) Registering the calendar in the KIE session ksession.getCalendars().set( \"weekday\", weekDayCal ); You can use calendars with standard rules and with rules that use timers. The calendar attribute can contain one or more comma-separated calendar names written as String literals. The following example rules use both calendars and timers to schedule the rules: Example rules with calendars and timers rule \"Weekdays are high priority\" calendars \"weekday\" timer ( int:0 1h ) when Alarm() then send( \"priority high - we have an alarm\" ); end rule \"Weekends are low priority\" calendars \"weekend\" timer ( int:0 4h ) when Alarm() then send( \"priority low - we have an alarm\" ); end Figure 7. Rule Figure 8. Conditional element in a rule The when part of a DRL rule (also known as the Left Hand Side (LHS) of the rule) contains the conditions that must be met to execute an action. Conditions consist of a series of stated OOPath expressions of patterns and constraints, with optional bindings and supported rule condition elements (keywords), based on the available data objects in the package. OOPath is an object-oriented syntax extension to XPath for navigating through related elements while handling collections and filtering constraints. For example, in a decision service that raises alerts when the temperature reaches or exceeds 80 degrees, a rule tooHot contains the when condition /temperature[value >= 80]. DRL uses when instead of if because if is typically part of a procedural execution flow during which a condition is checked at a specific point in time. In contrast, when indicates that the condition evaluation is not limited to a specific evaluation sequence or point in time, but instead occurs continually at any time. Whenever the condition is met, the actions are executed. If the when section is empty, then the conditions are considered to be true and the actions in the then section are executed the first time the rules are fired. This is useful if you want to use rules to set up the Drools rule engine state. The following example rule uses empty conditions to insert a fact every time the rule is executed: Example rule without conditions rule \"start-up\" when // Empty then // Actions to be executed once alerts.add( new Alert(\"INFO\", \"System started\") ); end Formally, the core grammar of an OOPath expression is defined in extended Backus-Naur form (EBNF) notation in the following way: EBNF notation for OOPath expressions OOPExpr = [ID ( \":\" | \":=\" )] ( \"/\" | \"?/\" ) OOPSegment { ( \"/\" | \"?/\" | \".\" ) OOPSegment } ; OOPSegment = ID [\"#\" ID] [\"[\" ( Number | Constraints ) \"]\"] An OOPath expression of a pattern in a DRL rule condition is the segment to be matched by the Drools rule engine. An OOPath expression can potentially match each fact that is inserted into the working memory of the Drools rule engine. It can also contain constraints to further define the facts to be matched. In the simplest form, with no constraints, an OOPath expression matches a fact in the given data source. In the following example with a DataSource named persons, the expression matches against all Person objects in the data source of the Drools rule engine: Example expression for a single fact type /persons Patterns can also refer to superclasses or even interfaces, potentially matching facts from many different classes. For example, the following pattern matches all Student subtypes of the Person object: Example pattern for subtypes /persons # Student Square brackets in a pattern enclose the constraints, such as the following constraint on the person’s age: Example pattern with a constraint /persons[ age == 50 ] A constraint is an expression that returns true or false. Constraints in DRL are essentially Java expressions with some enhancements, such as property access, and some differences, such as equals() and !equals() semantics for == and != (instead of the usual same and not same semantics). Any JavaBeans property can be accessed directly from pattern constraints. A JavaBeans property is exposed internally using a standard JavaBeans getter that takes no arguments and returns something. For example, the age property is written as age in DRL instead of the getter getAge(): DRL constraint syntax with JavaBeans properties /persons[ age == 50 ] // This is equivalent to the following getter format: /persons[ getAge() == 50 ] Drools uses the standard JDK Introspector class to achieve this mapping and follows the standard JavaBeans specification. For optimal Drools rule engine performance, use the property access format, such as age, instead of using getters explicitly, such as getAge(). Do not use property accessors to change the state of the object in a way that might affect the rules because the Drools rule engine caches the results of the match between invocations for higher efficiency. For example, do not use property accessors in the following ways: public int getAge() { age++; // Do not do this. return age; } public int getAge() { Date now = DateUtil.now(); // Do not do this. return DateUtil.differenceInYears(now, birthday); } Instead of following the second example, insert a fact that wraps the current date in the working memory and update that fact between rule executions as needed. However, if the getter of a property cannot be found, the compiler uses the property name as a fallback method name, without arguments: Fallback method if object is not found /persons[ age == 50 ] // If `Person.getAge()` does not exist, the compiler uses the following syntax: /persons[ age() == 50 ] You can also nest access properties in patterns, as shown in the following example. Nested properties are indexed by the Drools rule engine. Example pattern with nested property access /persons[ address.houseNumber == 50 ] // This is equivalent to the following expression: /persons[ getAddress().getHouseNumber() == 50 ] You can use any Java expression that returns a boolean value as a constraint inside the parentheses of a pattern. Java expressions can be mixed with other expression enhancements, such as property access: Example pattern with a constraint using property access and Java expression /persons[ age == 50 ] You can change the evaluation priority by using parentheses, as in any logical or mathematical expression: Example evaluation order of constraints /persons[ age > 100 && ( age % 10 == 0 ) ] You can also reuse Java methods in constraints, as shown in the following example: Example constraints with reused Java methods /persons[ Math.round( weight / ( height * height ) ) 50, weight > 80 ] // Person is more than 50 years old, weighs more than 80 kilograms, and is taller than 2 meters: /persons[ age > 50, weight > 80, height > 2 ] Although the && and , operators have the same semantics, they are resolved with different priorities. The && operator precedes the || operator, and both the && and || operators together precede the , operator. Use the comma operator at the top-level constraint for optimal Drools rule engine performance and human readability. You cannot embed a comma operator in a composite constraint expression, such as in parentheses: Example of misused comma in composite constraint expression // Do not use the following format: /persons[ ( age > 50, weight > 80 ) || height > 2 ] // Use the following format instead: /persons[ ( age > 50 && weight > 80 ) || height > 2 ] When you write multiple OOPath lines when /persons[ age == \"10\" ] /addresses[ city == \"London\" ] Before Drools 10, they were concatenated to one line /persons[ age == \"10\" ]/addresses[ city == \"London\" ]. To avoid that, you need to explicitly use a semicolon ; to separate the OOPath lines. when /persons[ age == \"10\" ]; /addresses[ city == \"London\" ]; Since Drools 10, Drools considers the new line as a separator between OOPath lines. So the semicolon is not required. You can bind variables to OOPath expressions of patterns and constraints to refer to matched objects in other portions of a rule. Bound variables can help you define rules more efficiently or more consistently with how you annotate facts in your data model. For example, the following DRL rule uses the variable $p for an OOPath expression with the Person fact: Pattern with a bound variable rule \"simple rule\" when $p : /persons then System.out.println( \"Person \" + p ); end Similarly, you can also bind variables to nested properties, as shown in the following example: // Two persons of the same age: /persons[ firstAge : age ] // Binding and /persons[ age == firstAge ] // Constraint expression Ensure that you separate constraint bindings and constraint expressions for clearer and more efficient rule definitions. Although mixed bindings and expressions are supported, they can complicate patterns and affect evaluation efficiency. // Do not use the following format: /persons[ age : age * 2 10000000 ] These example patterns cast Address to LongAddress, and additionally to DetailedCountry in the last example, making the parent getters available to the subtypes in each case. By default, the Drools rule engine supports the date format dd-mmm-yyyy. You can customize the date format, including a time format mask if needed, by providing an alternative format mask with the system property drools.dateformat=\"dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm\". You can also customize the date format by changing the language locale with the drools.defaultlanguage and drools.defaultcountry system properties. For example, the locale of Thailand is set as drools.defaultlanguage=th and drools.defaultcountry=TH. Example pattern with a date literal restriction /persons[ bornBefore 10000000 ] !. Use this operator to dereference a property in a null-safe way. The value to the left of the !. operator must be not null (interpreted as != null) in order to give a positive result for pattern matching. Example constraint with null-safe dereferencing /persons[ $streetName : address!.street ] // This is internally rewritten in the following way: /persons[ address != null, $streetName : address.street ] [] Use this operator to access a List value by index or a Map value by key. Example constraints with List and Map access // The following format is the same as `childList(0).getAge() == 18`: /persons[childList[0].age == 18] // The following format is the same as `credentialMap.get(\"jdoe\").isValid()`: /persons[credentialMap[\"jdoe\"].valid] , >= Use these operators on properties with natural ordering. For example, for Date fields, the 30 && 30 && 20 && 30 && >, >>>, , >=, instanceof Equality == != Uses equals() and !equals() semantics, not standard Java same and not same semantics Non-short-circuiting AND & Non-short-circuiting exclusive OR ^ Non-short-circuiting inclusive OR | Logical AND && Logical OR || Ternary ? : Comma-separated AND , Not standard Java semantics DRL supports the following rule condition elements (keywords) that you can use with the patterns that you define in DRL rule conditions: and Use this to group conditional components into a logical conjunction. Infix and prefix and are supported. You can group patterns explicitly with parentheses (). By default, all listed patterns are combined with and when no conjunction is specified. Figure 12. infixAnd Figure 13. prefixAnd Example patterns with and //Infix `and`: colorType: /colors/type and /persons[ favoriteColor == colorType ] //Infix `and` with grouping: (colorType: /colors/type and (/persons[ favoriteColor == colorType ] or /persons[ favoriteColor == colorType ]) // Prefix `and`: (and colorType: /colors/type /persons[ favoriteColor == colorType ]) // Default implicit `and`: colorType: /colors/type /persons[ favoriteColor == colorType ] Do not use a leading declaration binding with the and keyword (as you can with or, for example). A declaration can only reference a single fact at a time, and if you use a declaration binding with and, then when and is satisfied, it matches both facts and results in an error. Example misuse of and // Causes compile error: $person : (/persons[ name == \"Romeo\" ] and /persons[ name == \"Juliet\"]) or Use this to group conditional components into a logical disjunction. Infix and prefix or are supported. You can group patterns explicitly with parentheses (). You can also use pattern binding with or, but each pattern must be bound separately. Figure 14. infixOr Figure 15. prefixOr Example patterns with or //Infix `or`: colorType: /colors/type or /persons[ favoriteColor == colorType] //Infix `or` with grouping: colorType: /colors/type or (/persons[ favoriteColor == colorType] and /persons[ favoriteColor == colorType]) // Prefix `or`: (or colorType: /colors/type /persons[ favoriteColor == colorType]) Example patterns with or and pattern binding pensioner : ( /persons[ sex == \"f\", age > 60 ] or /persons[ sex == \"m\", age > 65 ] ) (or pensioner : /persons[ sex == \"f\", age > 60 ] pensioner : /persons[ sex == \"m\", age > 65 ]) The behavior of the or condition element is different from the connective || operator for constraints and restrictions in field constraints. The Drools rule engine does not directly interpret the or element but uses logical transformations to rewrite a rule with or as a number of sub-rules. This process ultimately results in a rule that has a single or as the root node and one sub-rule for each of its condition elements. Each sub-rule is activated and executed like any normal rule, with no special behavior or interaction between the sub-rules. Therefore, consider the or condition element a shortcut for generating two or more similar rules that, in turn, can create multiple internalMatches when two or more terms of the disjunction are true. exists Use this to specify facts and constraints that must exist. This option is triggered on only the first match, not subsequent matches. If you use this element with multiple patterns, enclose the patterns with parentheses (). Figure 16. Exists Example patterns with exists exists /persons[ firstName == \"John\"] exists (/persons[ firstName == \"John\", age == 42 ]) exists (/persons[ firstName == \"John\" ] and /persons[ lastName == \"Doe\" ]) not Use this to specify facts and constraints that must not exist. If you use this element with multiple patterns, enclose the patterns with parentheses (). Figure 17. Not Example patterns with not not /persons[ firstName == \"John\"] not (/persons[ firstName == \"John\", age == 42 )] not (/persons[ firstName == \"John\" ] and /persons[ lastName == \"Doe\" ]) forall Use this to verify whether all facts that match the first pattern match all the remaining patterns. When a forall construct is satisfied, the rule evaluates to true. This element is a scope delimiter, so it can use any previously bound variable, but no variable bound inside of it is available for use outside of it. Figure 18. Forall Example rule with forall rule \"All full-time employees have red ID badges\" when forall( $emp : /employees[ type == \"fulltime\" ] /employees[ this == $emp, badgeColor == \"red\" ] ) then // True, all full-time employees have red ID badges. end In this example, the rule selects all employee objects whose type is \"fulltime\". For each fact that matches this pattern, the rule evaluates the patterns that follow (badge color) and if they match, the rule evaluates to true. To state that all facts of a given type in the working memory of the Drools rule engine must match a set of constraints, you can use forall with a single pattern for simplicity. Example rule with forall and a single pattern rule \"All employees have red ID badges\" when forall( /employees[ badgeColor == \"red\" ] ) then // True, all employees have red ID badges. end You can use forall constructs with multiple patterns or nest them with other condition elements, such as inside a not element construct. Example rule with forall and multiple patterns rule \"All employees have health and dental care programs\" when forall( $emp : /employees /healthCare[ employee == $emp ] /dentalCare[ employee == $emp ] ) then // True, all employees have health and dental care. end Example rule with forall and not rule \"Not all employees have health and dental care\" when not ( forall( $emp : /employees /healthCare[ employee == $emp ] /dentalCare[ employee == $emp ] ) ) then // True, not all employees have health and dental care. end The format forall( p1 p2 p3 …​) is equivalent to not( p1 and not( and p2 p3 …​ ) ). accumulate Use this to iterate over a collection of objects, execute custom actions for each of the elements, and return one or more result objects (if the constraints evaluate to true). You can use predefined functions in your accumulate conditions or implement custom functions as needed. You can also use the abbreviation acc for accumulate in rule conditions. Use the following format to define accumulate conditions in rules: Preferred format for accumulate accumulate( SOURCE_PATTERN; FUNCTIONS [;CONSTRAINTS] ) Figure 19. Accumulate Although the Drools rule engine supports alternate formats for the accumulate element for backward compatibility, this format is preferred for optimal performance in rules and applications. The Drools rule engine supports the following predefined accumulate functions. These functions accept any expression as input. average min max count sum collectList collectSet In the following example rule, min, max, and average are accumulate functions that calculate the minimum, maximum, and average temperature values over all the readings for each sensor: Example rule with accumulate to calculate temperature values rule \"Raise alarm\" when s : /sensors accumulate( /readings( sensor == $s, $temp : temperature ); $min : min( $temp ), $max : max( $temp ), $avg : average( $temp ); $min 70 ) then // Raise the alarm. end The following example rule uses the average function with accumulate to calculate the average profit for all items in an order: Example rule with accumulate to calculate average profit rule \"Average profit\" when $order : /orders accumulate( /orderItems( order == $order, $cost : cost, $price : price ); $avgProfit : average( 1 - $cost / $price ) ) then // Average profit for `$order` is `$avgProfit`. end Built-in accumulate functions' return types may vary depend on parameter types. min and max can take Comparable parameters even if they are not numeric types, for example, LocalDateTime. In this case, the return type would be Comparable, so you may need to cast the bind variable of the return value in the rule. To use custom, domain-specific functions in accumulate conditions, create a Java class that implements the org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction interface. For example, the following Java class defines a custom implementation of an AverageData function: Example Java class with custom implementation of average function // An implementation of an accumulator capable of calculating average values public class AverageAccumulateFunction implements org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction { public void readExternal(ObjectInput in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException { } public void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out) throws IOException { } public static class AverageData implements Externalizable { public int count = 0; public double total = 0; public AverageData() {} public void readExternal(ObjectInput in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException { count = in.readInt(); total = in.readDouble(); } public void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out) throws IOException { out.writeInt(count); out.writeDouble(total); } } /* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction#createContext() */ public AverageData createContext() { return new AverageData(); } /* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction#init(java.io.Serializable) */ public void init(AverageData context) { context.count = 0; context.total = 0; } /* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction#accumulate(java.io.Serializable, java.lang.Object) */ public void accumulate(AverageData context, Object value) { context.count++; context.total += ((Number) value).doubleValue(); } /* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction#reverse(java.io.Serializable, java.lang.Object) */ public void reverse(AverageData context, Object value) { context.count--; context.total -= ((Number) value).doubleValue(); } /* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction#getResult(java.io.Serializable) */ public Object getResult(AverageData context) { return new Double( context.count == 0 ? 0 : context.total / context.count ); } /* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction#supportsReverse() */ public boolean supportsReverse() { return true; } /* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction#getResultType() */ public Class getResultType() { return Number.class; } } To use the custom function in a DRL rule, import the function using the import accumulate statement: Format to import a custom function import accumulate CLASS_NAME FUNCTION_NAME Example rule with the imported average function import accumulate AverageAccumulateFunction.AverageData average rule \"Average profit\" when $order : /orders accumulate( /orderItems[ order == $order, $cost : cost, $price : price ]; $avgProfit : average( 1 - $cost / $price ) ) then // Average profit for `$order` is `$avgProfit`. end For backward compatibility, the Drools rule engine also supports the configuration of accumulate functions through configuration files and system properties, but this is a deprecated method. To configure the average function from the previous example using the configuration file or system property, set a property as shown in the following example: drools.accumulate.function.average = AverageAccumulateFunction.AverageData Note that drools.accumulate.function is a required prefix, average is how the function is used in the DRL files, and AverageAccumulateFunction.AverageData is the fully qualified name of the class that implements the function behavior. groupby Use this to partition a collection of objects into groups, and perform accumulate functions independently on each group. You can use predefined functions in your groupby conditions or implement custom functions as needed. Use the following format to define groupby conditions in rules: Preferred format for groupby groupby( SOURCE_PATTERN; KEY_FUNCTION ; FUNCTIONS [;CONSTRAINTS] ) Figure 20. Groupby The Drools rule engine supports the same predefined accumulate functions that accumulate allows. These functions accept any expression as input. In the following example rule, min, max, and average are accumulate functions that calculate the minimum, maximum, and average temperature values over all the readings for each sensor by area: Example rule with groupby to calculate temperature values rule \"Raise alarm\" when s : /sensors groupby( /readings( sensor == $s, $temp : temperature, $area: area ); $group: $area ; $min : min( $temp ), $max : max( $temp ), $avg : average( $temp ); $min 70 ) then // Raise the alarm for the group. $group.raiseAlarm(); end The following example rule uses the average function with accumulate to calculate the average profit for all items in an order: Example rule with groupby to calculate average profit rule \"Average profit\" when groupby( /orderItems( $order : order, $cost : cost, $price : price ); $group: $order; $avgProfit : average( 1 - $cost / $price ) ) then // Average profit for `$group` is `$avgProfit`. end Built-in accumulate functions' return types may vary depend on parameter types. min and max can take Comparable parameters even if they are not numeric types, for example, LocalDateTime. In this case, the return type would be Comparable, so you may need to cast the bind variable of the return value in the rule. To use custom, domain-specific functions in groupby conditions, follow the same procedure as accumulate. To use the custom function in a DRL rule, import the function using the import accumulate statement: Format to import a custom function import accumulate CLASS_NAME FUNCTION_NAME Example rule with the imported average function import accumulate AverageAccumulateFunction.AverageData average rule \"Average profit\" when groupby( /orderItems[ $order : order, $cost : cost, $price : price ]; $group: $order; $avgProfit : average( 1 - $cost / $price ) ) then // Average profit for `$group` is `$avgProfit`. end The then part of the rule (also known as the Right Hand Side (RHS) of the rule) contains the actions to be performed when the conditional part of the rule has been met. Rule actions are typically determined by one or more data sources that you define as part of your DRL rule unit. For example, if a bank requires loan applicants to have over 21 years of age (with a rule condition /applicants[ applicantName : name, age ) { , , ... } Example rule action to modify a loan application amount and approval modify( $application ) { setAmount( 100 ), setApproved ( true ) } update Use this to specify fields and the entire related fact to be updated and to notify the Drools rule engine of the change. After a fact has changed, you must call update before changing another fact that might be affected by the updated values. To avoid this added step, use the modify method instead. update ( ) // Informs the Drools rule engine that an object has changed update ( ) // Causes `KieSession` to search for a fact handle of the object Example rule action to update a loan application amount and approval $application.setAmount( 100 ); update( $application ); When modify or update is called in a rule, its actual evaluation happens after executing the whole RHS code. It means all modifications in the RHS will affect in the evaluation. For example, $application.setAmount( 100 ); update( $application ); $application.setApproved( true ); The modifications of both amount and approved are considered in the evaluation of the update. If you provide property-change listeners, you do not need to call this method when an object changes. For more information about property-change listeners, see Property-change settings and listeners for fact types. insert Use this to insert a new fact into the working memory of the Drools rule engine and to define resulting fields and values as needed for the fact. insert( new ); Example rule action to insert a new loan applicant object insert( new Applicant() ); insert and insertLogical insert a fact into \"DEFAULT\" entry-point. In Rule Unit use cases, you must specify a DataSource where you want to insert the fact. Hence, you must call DataStore.add instead of insert and DataStore.addLogical instead of insertLogical. insertLogical Use this to insert a new fact logically into the Drools rule engine. The Drools rule engine is responsible for logical decisions on insertions and retractions of facts. After regular or stated insertions, facts must be retracted explicitly. After logical insertions, the facts that were inserted are automatically retracted when the conditions in the rules that inserted the facts are no longer true. insertLogical( new ); Example rule action to logically insert a new loan applicant object insertLogical( new Applicant() ); delete Use this to remove an object from the Drools rule engine. The keyword retract is also supported in DRL and executes the same action, but delete is typically preferred in DRL code for consistency with the keyword insert. delete( ); Example rule action to delete a loan applicant object delete( Applicant ); In addition to the standard rule action methods, the Drools rule engine supports methods in conjunction with the predefined drools variable that you can also use in rule actions. You can use the drools variable to call methods from the org.kie.api.runtime.rule.RuleContext class in your Drools distribution, which is also the class that the standard rule action methods are based on. For all drools rule action options, see the Drools RuleContext.java page in GitHub. The drools variable contains methods that provide information about the firing rule and the set of facts that activated the firing rule: drools.getRule().getName(): Returns the name of the currently firing rule. drools.getMatch(): Returns the Match that activated the currently firing rule. It contains information that is useful for logging and debugging purposes, for instance drools.getMatch().getObjects() returns the list of objects, enabling rule to fire in the proper tuple order. From the drools variable, you can also obtain a reference to the KieRuntime providing useful methods to interact with the running session, for example: drools.getKieRuntime().halt(): Terminates rule execution if a user or application previously called fireUntilHalt(). When a user or application calls fireUntilHalt() method, the Drools rule engine starts in active mode and evaluates rules until the user or application explicitly calls halt() method. Otherwise, by default, the Drools rule engine runs in passive mode and evaluates rules only when a user or an application explicitly calls fireAllRules() method. drools.getKieRuntime().getAgenda(): Returns a reference to the KIE session Agenda, and in turn provides access to rule internalMatch groups, rule agenda groups, and ruleflow groups. Example call to access agenda group \"CleanUp\" and set the focus drools.getKieRuntime().getAgenda().getAgendaGroup( \"CleanUp\" ).setFocus(); + This example sets the focus to a specified agenda group to which the rule belongs. drools.getKieRuntime().setGlobal(), ~.getGlobal(), ~.getGlobals(): Sets or retrieves global variables. drools.getKieRuntime().getEnvironment(): Returns the runtime Environment, similar to your operating system environment. drools.getKieRuntime().getQueryResults( query): Runs a query and returns the results. When you use rule units, drools.getKieRuntime() is not available, because rule units use lightweight sessions. DRL supports single-line comments prefixed with a double forward slash // and multi-line comments enclosed with a forward slash and asterisk /* …​ */. You can use DRL comments to annotate rules or any related components in DRL files. DRL comments are ignored by the Drools rule engine when the DRL file is processed. Example rule with comments rule \"Underage\" // This is a single-line comment. when /applicants[ applicantName : name, age ' in rule \"simple rule\" in pattern student A line and column value of 0:-1 means the parser reached the end of the source file () but encountered incomplete constructs, usually due to missing quotation marks \"…​\", apostrophes '…​', or parentheses (…​). 102: mismatched input Indicates that the parser expected a particular symbol that is missing at the current input position. Example rule with an incomplete rule statement 1: rule \"simple rule\" 2: when 3: $p : /persons[ // Must be a complete rule statement Error message [ERR 102] Line 0:-1 mismatched input '' expecting ']' in rule \"simple rule\" in pattern person A line and column value of 0:-1 means the parser reached the end of the source file () but encountered incomplete constructs, usually due to missing quotation marks \"…​\", apostrophes '…​', or parentheses (…​). Example rule with incorrect syntax 1: package org.drools.examples; 2: 3: rule \"Wrong syntax\" 4: when 5: not /cars[ ( type == \"tesla\", price == 10000 ) || ( type == \"kia\", price == 1000 ) ] // Must use `&&` operators instead of commas `,` 6: then 7: System.out.println(\"OK\"); 8: end Error messages [ERR 102] Line 5:36 mismatched input ',' expecting ')' in rule \"Wrong syntax\" in pattern car [ERR 101] Line 5:57 no viable alternative at input 'type' in rule \"Wrong syntax\" [ERR 102] Line 5:106 mismatched input ']' expecting 'then' in rule \"Wrong syntax\" In this example, the syntactic problem results in multiple error messages related to each other. The single solution of replacing the commas , with && operators resolves all errors. If you encounter multiple errors, resolve one at a time in case errors are consequences of previous errors. 103: failed predicate Indicates that a validating semantic predicate evaluated to false. These semantic predicates are typically used to identify component keywords in DRL files, such as declare, rule, exists, not, and others. Example rule with an invalid keyword 1: package nesting; 2: 3: import org.drools.compiler.Person 4: import org.drools.compiler.Address 5: 6: Some text // Must be a valid DRL keyword 7: 8: rule \"test something\" 9: when 10: $p: /persons[ name==\"Michael\" ] 11: then 12: $p.name = \"other\"; 13: System.out.println(p.name); 14: end Error message [ERR 103] Line 6:0 rule 'rule_key' failed predicate: {(validateIdentifierKey(DroolsSoftKeywords.RULE))}? in rule The Some text line is invalid because it does not begin with or is not a part of a DRL keyword construct, so the parser fails to validate the rest of the DRL file. This error is similar to 102: mismatched input, but usually involves DRL keywords. 105: did not match anything Indicates that the parser reached a sub-rule in the grammar that must match an alternative at least once, but the sub-rule did not match anything. The parser has entered a branch with no way out. Example rule with invalid text in an empty condition 1: rule \"empty condition\" 2: when 3: None // Must remove `None` if condition is empty 4: then 5: insert( new Person() ); 6: end Error message [ERR 105] Line 2:2 required (...)+ loop did not match anything at input 'WHEN' in rule \"empty condition\" In this example, the condition is intended to be empty but the word None is used. This error is resolved by removing None, which is not a valid DRL keyword, data type, or pattern construct. The following Drools Rule Language (DRL) conventions are no longer applicable or optimal in Drools but might be available for backward compatibility. Figure 23. Function Functions in DRL files put semantic code in your rule source file instead of in Java classes. Functions are especially useful if an action (then) part of a rule is used repeatedly and only the parameters differ for each rule. Above the rules in the DRL file, you can declare the function or import a static method from a helper class as a function, and then use the function by name in an action (then) part of the rule. The following examples illustrate a function that is either declared or an imported static method in a DRL file: Example function declaration with a rule (option 1) function String hello(String applicantName) { return \"Hello \" + applicantName + \"!\"; } rule \"Using a function\" when // Empty then System.out.println( hello( \"James\" ) ); end Example import a static method of a Java class (option 2) package org.example.applicant; public class MyFunctions { public static String hello(String applicantName) { return \"Hello \" + applicantName + \"!\"; } } import static org.example.applicant.MyFunctions.hello; rule \"Using a function\" when // Empty then System.out.println( hello( \"James\" ) ); end A function declared in a DRL file cannot be imported to a rule in a different package while a Java static method in a different package can be imported. A function body cannot access globals. From the RHS of a rule, you can always pass a global as a function parameter when invoking the function, for exmaple: global List names; rule \"Using a function with parameters\" when // Empty then addName( names, \"James\" ); end function void addName(List names, String applicantName) { names.add(applicantName); } The following attributes were used in earlier versions of the Drools rule engine to provide grouping of rules across a rule base. These attributes are superseded by DRL rule units and are only available for backward compatibility reasons. If you need to group your rules, use DRL rule units as a clearer and simpler grouping method. Table 3. Legacy rule attributes Attribute Value agenda-group A string identifying an agenda group to which you want to assign the rule. Agenda groups allow you to partition the agenda to provide more execution control over groups of rules. Only rules in an agenda group that has acquired a focus are able to be activated. Example: agenda-group \"GroupName\" ruleflow-group A string identifying a rule flow group. In rule flow groups, rules can fire only when the group is activated by the associated rule flow. Example: ruleflow-group \"GroupName\" In Drools, the preferred syntax for DRL rule conditions is through OOPath expressions. For legacy use cases, you can write rules using traditional pattern matching. In this case, you must explicitly indicate the data source using the from clause, as shown in the following comparative examples: Example PersonRules DRL file using OOPath notation package org.acme unit PersonRules; import org.acme.Person; rule isAdult when $person: /persons[ age > 18 ] then modify($person) { setAdult(true) }; end Example PersonRules DRL file using traditional notation package org.acme unit PersonRules; import org.acme.Person; rule isAdult when $person: Person(age > 18) from person then modify($person) { setAdult(true) }; end Using OOPath, you can write nested paths. For example, /persons[name == \"Mark\"]/addresses[city == \"london\"]/…​. The first path persons is translated into a normal pattern matching, but all other paths after that first one are rendered with a from clause that has performance inefficiency. Hence, you have to be careful about using nested paths the same as too much use of from. The following rule condition elements (keywords) are obsolete in Drools: from (Obsolete with OOPath notation) Use this to specify a data source for a pattern. This enables the Drools rule engine to reason over data that is not in the working memory. The data source can be a sub-field on a bound variable or the result of a method call. The expression used to define the object source is any expression that follows regular MVEL syntax. Therefore, the from element enables you to easily use object property navigation, execute method calls, and access maps and collection elements. Figure 24. from Example rule with from and pattern binding rule \"Validate zipcode\" when Person( $personAddress : address ) Address( zipcode == \"23920W\" ) from $personAddress then // Zip code is okay. end Example rule with from and a graph notation rule \"Validate zipcode\" when $p : Person() $a : Address( zipcode == \"23920W\" ) from $p.address then // Zip code is okay. end Example rule with from to iterate over all objects rule \"Apply 10% discount to all items over US$ 100 in an order\" when $order : Order() $item : OrderItem( value > 100 ) from $order.items then // Apply discount to `$item`. end For large collections of objects, instead of adding an object with a large graph that the Drools rule engine must iterate over frequently, add the collection directly to the KIE session and then join the collection in the condition, as shown in the following example: when $order : Order() OrderItem( value > 100, order == $order ) Example rule with from and lock-on-active rule attribute rule \"Assign people in North Carolina (NC) to sales region 1\" ruleflow-group \"test\" lock-on-active true when $p : Person() $a : Address( state == \"NC\" ) from $p.address then modify ($p) {} // Assign the person to sales region 1. end rule \"Apply a discount to people in the city of Raleigh\" ruleflow-group \"test\" lock-on-active true when $p : Person() $a : Address( city == \"Raleigh\" ) from $p.address then modify ($p) {} // Apply discount to the person. end Using from with lock-on-active rule attribute can result in rules not being executed. You can address this issue in one of the following ways: Avoid using the from element when you can insert all facts into the working memory of the Drools rule engine or use nested object references in your constraint expressions. Place the variable used in the modify() block as the last sentence in your rule condition. Avoid using the lock-on-active rule attribute when you can explicitly manage how rules within the same ruleflow group place internalMatches on one another. The pattern that contains a from clause cannot be followed by another pattern starting with a parenthesis. The reason for this restriction is that the DRL parser reads the from expression as \"from $l (String() or Number())\" and it cannot differentiate this expression from a function call. The simplest workaround to this is to wrap the from clause in parentheses, as shown in the following example: Example rules with from used incorrectly and correctly // Do not use `from` in this way: rule R when $l : List() String() from $l (String() or Number()) then // Actions end // Use `from` in this way instead: rule R when $l : List() (String() from $l) (String() or Number()) then // Actions end entry-point (Superseded by rule unit data sources) Use this to define an entry point, or event stream, corresponding to a data source for the pattern. This element is typically used with the from condition element. You can declare an entry point for events so that the Drools rule engine uses data from only that entry point to evaluate the rules. You can declare an entry point either implicitly by referencing it in DRL rules or explicitly in your Java application. Example rule with from entry-point rule \"Authorize withdrawal\" when WithdrawRequest( $ai : accountId, $am : amount ) from entry-point \"ATM Stream\" CheckingAccount( accountId == $ai, balance > $am ) then // Authorize withdrawal. end collect (Obsolete with OOPath notation) Use this to define a collection of objects that the rule can use as part of the condition. The rule obtains the collection either from a specified source or from the working memory of the Drools rule engine. The result pattern of the collect element can be any concrete class that implements the java.util.Collection interface and provides a default no-arg public constructor. You can use Java collections like List, LinkedList, and HashSet, or your own class. If variables are bound before the collect element in a condition, you can use the variables to constrain both your source and result patterns. However, any binding made inside the collect element is not available for use outside of it. Figure 25. Collect Example rule with collect import java.util.List rule \"Raise priority when system has more than three pending alarms\" when $system : System() $alarms : List( size >= 3 ) from collect( Alarm( system == $system, status == 'pending' ) ) then // Raise priority because `$system` has three or more `$alarms` pending. end In this example, the rule assesses all pending alarms in the working memory of the Drools rule engine for each given system and groups them in a List. If three or more alarms are found for a given system, the rule is executed. You can also use the collect element with nested from elements, as shown in the following example: Example rule with collect and nested from import java.util.LinkedList; rule \"Send a message to all parents\" when $town : Town( name == 'Paris' ) $mothers : LinkedList() from collect( Person( children > 0 ) from $town.getPeople() ) then // Send a message to all parents. end accumulate alternate syntax for a single function with return type The accumulate syntax evolved over time with the goal of becoming more compact and expressive. Nevertheless, Drools still supports previous syntaxes for backward compatibility purposes. In case the rule is using a single accumulate function on a given accumulate, the author may add a pattern for the result object and use the \"from\" keyword to link it to the accumulate result. Example: a rule to apply a 10% discount on orders over $100 could be written in the following way: rule \"Apply 10% discount to orders over US$ 100,00\" when $order : /orders $total : Number( doubleValue > 100 ) from accumulate( OrderItem( order == $order, $value : value ), sum( $value ) ) then // apply discount to $order end In the above example, the accumulate element is using only one function (sum), and so, the rules author opted to explicitly write a pattern for the result type of the accumulate function (Number) and write the constraints inside it. There are no problems in using this syntax over the compact syntax presented before, except that is is a bit more verbose. Also note that it is not allowed to use both the return type and the functions binding in the same accumulate statement. Compile-time checks are performed in order to ensure the pattern used with the \"from\" keyword is assignable from the result of the accumulate function used. With this syntax, the \"from\" binds to the single result returned by the accumulate function, and it does not iterate. In the above example, \"$total\" is bound to the result returned by the accumulate sum() function. As another example however, if the result of the accumulate function is a collection, \"from\" still binds to the single result and it does not iterate: rule \"Person names\" when $x : Object() from accumulate(MyPerson( $val : name ); collectList( $val ) ) then // $x is a List end The bound \"$x : Object()\" is the List itself, returned by the collectList accumulate function used. This is an important distinction to highlight, as the \"from\" keyword can also be used separately of accumulate, to iterate over the elements of a collection: rule \"Iterate the numbers\" when $xs : List() $x : Integer() from $xs then // $x matches and binds to each Integer in the collection end While this syntax is still supported for backward compatibility purposes, for this and other reasons we encourage rule authors to make use instead of the preferred accumulate syntax (described previously), to avoid any potential pitfalls. accumulate with inline custom code Another possible syntax for the accumulate is to define inline custom code, instead of using accumulate functions. The use of accumulate with inline custom code is not a good practice for several reasons, including difficulties on maintaining and testing rules that use them, as well as the inability of reusing that code. Implementing your own accumulate functions is very simple and straightforward, they are easy to unit test and to use. This form of accumulate is supported for backward compatibility only. Only limited support for inline accumulate is provided while using the executable model. For example, you cannot use an external binding in the code while using the MVEL dialect: rule R dialect \"mvel\" when String( $l : length ) $sum : Integer() from accumulate ( Person( age > 18, $age : age ), init( int sum = 0 * $l; ), action( sum += $age; ), reverse( sum -= $age; ), result( sum ) ) The general syntax of the accumulate CE with inline custom code is: RESULT_PATTERN from accumulate( SOURCE_PATTERN, init( INIT_CODE ), action( ACTION_CODE ), reverse( REVERSE_CODE ), result( RESULT_EXPRESSION ) ) The meaning of each of the elements is the following: SOURCE_PATTERN: the source pattern is a regular pattern that the Drools rule engine will try to match against each of the source objects. INIT_CODE: this is a semantic block of code in the selected dialect that will be executed once for each tuple, before iterating over the source objects. ACTION_CODE: this is a semantic block of code in the selected dialect that will be executed for each of the source objects. REVERSE_CODE: this is an optional semantic block of code in the selected dialect that if present will be executed for each source object that no longer matches the source pattern. The objective of this code block is to undo any calculation done in the ACTION_CODE block, so that the Drools rule engine can do decremental calculation when a source object is modified or deleted, hugely improving performance of these operations. RESULT_EXPRESSION: this is a semantic expression in the selected dialect that is executed after all source objects are iterated. RESULT_PATTERN: this is a regular pattern that the Drools rule engine tries to match against the object returned from the RESULT_EXPRESSION. If it matches, the accumulate conditional element evaluates to true and the Drools rule engine proceeds with the evaluation of the next CE in the rule. If it does not matches, the accumulate CE evaluates to false and the Drools rule engine stops evaluating CEs for that rule. It is easier to understand if we look at an example: rule \"Apply 10% discount to orders over US$ 100,00\" when $order : Order() $total : Number( doubleValue > 100 ) from accumulate( OrderItem( order == $order, $value : value ), init( double total = 0; ), action( total += $value; ), reverse( total -= $value; ), result( total ) ) then // apply discount to $order end In the above example, for each Order in the Working Memory, the Drools rule engine will execute the INIT_CODE initializing the total variable to zero. Then it will iterate over all OrderItem objects for that order, executing the action for each one (in the example, it will sum the value of all items into the total variable). After iterating over all OrderItem objects, it will return the value corresponding to the result expression (in the above example, the value of variable total). Finally, the Drools rule engine will try to match the result with the Number pattern, and if the double value is greater than 100, the rule will fire. The example used Java as the semantic dialect, and as such, note that the usage of the semicolon as statement delimiter is mandatory in the init, action and reverse code blocks. The result is an expression and, as such, it does not admit ';'. If the user uses any other dialect, he must comply to that dialect’s specific syntax. As mentioned before, the REVERSE_CODE is optional, but it is strongly recommended that the user writes it in order to benefit from the improved performance on update and delete. The accumulate CE can be used to execute any action on source objects. The following example instantiates and populates a custom object: rule \"Accumulate using custom objects\" when $person : Person( $likes : likes ) $cheesery : Cheesery( totalAmount > 100 ) from accumulate( $cheese : Cheese( type == $likes ), init( Cheesery cheesery = new Cheesery(); ), action( cheesery.addCheese( $cheese ); ), reverse( cheesery.removeCheese( $cheese ); ), result( cheesery ) ); then // do something end You can create and manage DRL rules for your Drools project in your integrated development environment (IDE). For Drools service, VSCode is the preferred IDE. In each DRL rule file, you define rule conditions, actions, and other components related to the rule, based on the data objects you create or import in the package. In Drools, you typically define DRL rules in rule units. A DRL rule unit is a module for rules and a unit of execution. A rule unit collects a set of rules with the declaration of the type of facts that the rules act on. A rule unit also serves as a unique namespace for each group of rules. A single rule base can contain multiple rule units. You typically store all the rules for a unit in the same file as the unit declaration so that the unit is self-contained. For this procedure, create the following example DRL type declarations and DRL rule unit to define DRL rules in a decision service for a loan application: Example DRL type declarations for a loan application package org.mortgages; declare Bankruptcy name: String yearOfOccurrence: int end declare Applicant name: String age: int end declare LoanApplication applicant: String approved: boolean explanation: String end Example DRL rule unit file for a loan application package org.mortgages; unit MortgageRules; import org.drools.ruleunits.api.RuleUnitData; import org.drools.ruleunits.api.DataStore; declare MortgageRules extends RuleUnitData bankruptcies: DataStore applicants: DataStore loanApplications: DataStore end rule \"Bankruptcy history\" salience 10 when $a : /loanApplications[ applicantName: applicant ] exists (/bankruptcies[ name == applicantName, yearOfOccurrence > 1990 || amountOwed > 100000 ]) then $a.setApproved( false ); $a.setExplanation( \"has been bankrupt\" ); loanApplications.remove( $a ); end rule \"Underage\" salience 15 when /applicants[ applicantName : name, age applicants: DataStore loanApplications: DataStore end ... In this example, the rule unit is named MortgageRules and the previously defined fact types are declared as DataStore data sources. Data sources are typed sources of data that rule units can subscribe to for updates. You interact with the rule unit through the data sources it exposes. A data source can be a DataStream source for append-only storage, a DataStore source for writable storage to add or remove data, or a SingletonStore source for writable storage to set and clear a single element. This example uses the DataStore data source to enable application data to be added or removed as part of the decision service. To complete the DRL rule unit file, add the following rules for \"Bankruptcy history\" and \"Underage\" logic: Example DRL rule unit file for a loan application package org.mortgages; unit MortgageRules; import org.drools.ruleunits.api.RuleUnitData; import org.drools.ruleunits.api.DataStore; declare MortgageRules extends RuleUnitData bankruptcies: DataStore applicants: DataStore loanApplications: DataStore end rule \"Bankruptcy history\" salience 10 when $a : /loanApplications[ applicantName: applicant ] exists (/bankruptcies[ name == applicantName, yearOfOccurrence > 1990 || amountOwed > 100000 ]) then $a.setApproved( false ); $a.setExplanation( \"has been bankrupt\" ); loanApplications.remove( $a ); end rule \"Underage\" salience 15 when /applicants[ applicantName : name, age 100000.00) from $c.employees In such cases, the Drools rule engine iterates over the large graph every time the rule condition is evaluated and impedes rule evaluation. Alternatively, instead of adding an object with a large graph that the Drools rule engine must iterate over frequently, add the collection directly to the KIE session and then join the collection in the condition, as shown in the following example: Example conditions without from clause when $c: Company(); Employee (salary > 100000.00, company == $c) In this example, the Drools rule engine iterates over the list only one time and can evaluate rules more efficiently. For more information about the from element or other DRL condition elements, see Rule conditions in DRL. Use Drools rule engine event listeners instead of System.out.println statements in rules for debug logging You can use System.out.println statements in your rule actions for debug logging and console output, but doing this for many rules can impede rule evaluation. As a more efficient alternative, use the built-in Drools rule engine event listeners when possible. If these listeners do not meet your requirements, use a system logging utility supported by the Drools rule engine, such as Logback, Apache Commons Logging, or Apache Log4j. For more information about supported Drools rule engine event listeners and logging utilities, see Drools rule engine event listeners and debug logging. Use the drools-metric module to identify the obstruction in your rules You can use the drools-metric module to identify slow rules especially when you process many rules. The drools-metric module can also assist in analyzing the Drools rule engine performance. Note that the drools-metric module is not for production environment use. However, you can perform the analysis in your test environment. To analyze the Drools rule engine performance using drools-metric, first add drools-metric to your project dependencies: Example project dependency for drools-metric org.drools drools-metric If you want to use drools-metric to enable trace logging, configure a logger for org.drools.metric.util.MetricLogUtils as shown in the following example: Example logback.xml configuration file ... Alternatively, you can use drools-metric to expose the data using Micrometer. To expose the data, enable the Micrometer registry of your choice as shown in the following example: Example project dependency for Micrometer io.micrometer micrometer-registry-jmx Example Java code for Micrometer Metrics.addRegitry(new JmxMeterRegistry(s -> null, Clock.SYSTEM)); If you want to use logging instead of Micrometer even though Micrometer is available in classpath, you can disable it by setting the system property drools.metric.micrometer.disabled to true. Regardless of whether you want to use logging or Micrometer, you need to enable MetricLogUtils by setting the system property drools.metric.logger.enabled to true. Optionally, you can change the microseconds threshold of metric reporting by setting the drools.metric.logger.threshold system property. Only node executions exceeding the threshold are reported. The default value is 500. After configuring the drools-metric to use logging, rule execution produces logs as shown in the following example: Example rule execution output TRACE [JoinNode(6) - [ClassObjectType class=com.sample.Order]], evalCount:1000, elapsedMicro:5962 TRACE [JoinNode(7) - [ClassObjectType class=com.sample.Order]], evalCount:100000, elapsedMicro:95553 TRACE [ AccumulateNode(8) ], evalCount:4999500, elapsedMicro:2172836 TRACE [EvalConditionNode(9)]: cond=com.sample.Rule_Collect_expensive_orders_combination930932360Eval1Invoker@ee2a6922], evalCount:49500, elapsedMicro:18787 This example includes the following key parameters: evalCount is the number of constraint evaluations against inserted facts during the node execution. When evalCount is used with Micrometer, a counter with the data is called org.drools.metric.evaluation.count. elapsedMicro is the elapsed time of the node execution in microseconds. When elapsedMicro is used with Micrometer, look for a timer called org.drools.metric.elapsed.time. If you find an outstanding evalCount or elapsedMicro log, correlate the node name with ReteDumper.dumpAssociatedRulesRete() output to identify the rule associated with the node. Example ReteDumper usage ReteDumper.dumpAssociatedRulesRete(kbase); Example ReteDumper output [ AccumulateNode(8) ] : [Collect expensive orders combination] ... Domain Specific Languages (or DSLs) are a way of creating a rule language that is dedicated to your problem domain. A set of DSL definitions consists of transformations from DSL \"sentences\" to DRL constructs, which lets you use of all the underlying rule language and engine features. Given a DSL, you write rules in DSL rule (or DSLR) files, which will be translated into DRL files. DSL and DSLR files are plain text files, and you can use any text editor to create and modify them. But there are also DSL and DSLR editors, both in the IDE as well as in the web based BRMS, and you can use those as well, although they may not provide you with the full DSL functionality. DSLs can serve as a layer of separation between rule authoring (and rule authors) and the technical intricacies resulting from the modelling of domain object and the Drools rule engine’s native language and methods. If your rules need to be read and validated by domain experts (such as business analysts, for instance) who are not programmers, you should consider using a DSL; it hides implementation details and focuses on the rule logic proper. DSL sentences can also act as \"templates\" for conditional elements and consequence actions that are used repeatedly in your rules, possibly with minor variations. You may define DSL sentences as being mapped to these repeated phrases, with parameters providing a means for accommodating those variations. DSLs have no impact on the Drools rule engine at runtime, they are just a compile time feature, requiring a special parser and transformer. The Drools DSL mechanism allows you to customise conditional expressions and consequence actions. A global substitution mechanism (\"keyword\") is also available. Example 1. Example DSL mapping [when]Something is {colour}=Something(colour==\"{colour}\") In the preceding example, [when] indicates the scope of the expression, i.e., whether it is valid for the LHS or the RHS of a rule. The part after the bracketed keyword is the expression that you use in the rule; typically a natural language expression, but it doesn’t have to be. The part to the right of the equal sign (\"=\") is the mapping of the expression into the rule language. The form of this string depends on its destination, RHS or LHS. If it is for the LHS, then it ought to be a term according to the regular LHS syntax; if it is for the RHS then it might be a Java statement. Whenever the DSL parser matches a line from the rule file written in the DSL with an expression in the DSL definition, it performs three steps of string manipulation. First, it extracts the string values appearing where the expression contains variable names in braces (here: {colour}). Then, the values obtained from these captures are then interpolated wherever that name, again enclosed in braces, occurs on the right hand side of the mapping. Finally, the interpolated string replaces whatever was matched by the entire expression in the line of the DSL rule file. Note that the expressions (i.e., the strings on the left hand side of the equal sign) are used as regular expressions in a pattern matching operation against a line of the DSL rule file, matching all or part of a line. This means you can use (for instance) a '?' to indicate that the preceding character is optional. One good reason to use this is to overcome variations in natural language phrases of your DSL. But, given that these expressions are regular expression patterns, this also means that all \"magic\" characters of Java’s pattern syntax have to be escaped with a preceding backslash ('\\'). It is important to note that the compiler transforms DSL rule files line by line. In the previous example, all the text after \"Something is \" to the end of the line is captured as the replacement value for \"{colour}\", and this is used for interpolating the target string. This may not be exactly what you want. For instance, when you intend to merge different DSL expressions to generate a composite DRL pattern, you need to transform a DSLR line in several independent operations. The best way to achieve this is to ensure that the captures are surrounded by characteristic text - words or even single characters. As a result, the matching operation done by the parser plucks out a substring from somewhere within the line. In the example below, quotes are used as distinctive characters. Note that the characters that surround the capture are not included during interpolation, just the contents between them. As a rule of thumb, use quotes for textual data that a rule editor may want to enter. You can also enclose the capture with words to ensure that the text is correctly matched. Both is illustrated by the following example. Note that a single line such as Something is \"green\" and another solid thing is now correctly expanded. Example 2. Example with quotes [when]something is \"{colour}\"=Something(colour==\"{colour}\") [when]another {state} thing=OtherThing(state==\"{state})\" It is a good idea to avoid punctuation (other than quotes or apostrophes) in your DSL expressions as much as possible. The main reason is that punctuation is easy to forget for rule authors using your DSL. Another reason is that parentheses, the period and the question mark are magic characters, requiring escaping in the DSL definition. In a DSL mapping, the braces \"{\" and \"}\" should only be used to enclose a variable definition or reference, resulting in a capture. If they should occur literally, either in the expression or within the replacement text on the right hand side, they must be escaped with a preceding backslash (\"\\\"): [then]do something= if (foo) \\{ doSomething(); \\} If braces \"{\" and \"}\" should appear in the replacement string of a DSL definition, escape them with a backslash ('\\'). Example 3. Examples of DSL mapping entries # This is a comment to be ignored. [when]There is a person with name of \"{name}\"=Person(name==\"{name}\") [when]Person is at least {age} years old and lives in \"{location}\"= Person(age >= {age}, location==\"{location}\") [then]Log \"{message}\"=System.out.println(\"{message}\"); [when]And = and Given the above DSL examples, the following examples show the expansion of various DSLR snippets: Example 4. Examples of DSL expansions There is a person with name of \"Kitty\" ==> Person(name=\"Kitty\") Person is at least 42 years old and lives in \"Atlanta\" ==> Person(age >= 42, location=\"Atlanta\") Log \"boo\" ==> System.out.println(\"boo\"); There is a person with name of \"Bob\" And Person is at least 30 years old and lives in \"Utah\" ==> Person(name=\"Bob\") and Person(age >= 30, location=\"Utah\") Don’t forget that if you are capturing plain text from a DSL rule line and want to use it as a string literal in the expansion, you must provide the quotes on the right hand side of the mapping. You can chain DSL expressions together on one line, as long as it is clear to the parser where one ends and the next one begins and where the text representing a parameter ends. (Otherwise you risk getting all the text until the end of the line as a parameter value.) The DSL expressions are tried, one after the other, according to their order in the DSL definition file. After any match, all remaining DSL expressions are investigated, too. The resulting DRL text may consist of more than one line. Line ends are in the replacement text are written as \\n. A common requirement when writing rule conditions is to be able to add an arbitrary combination of constraints to a pattern. Given that a fact type may have many fields, having to provide an individual DSL statement for each combination would be plain folly. The DSL facility allows you to add constraints to a pattern by a simple convention: if your DSL expression starts with a hyphen (minus character, \"-\") it is assumed to be a field constraint and, consequently, is is added to the last pattern line preceding it. For an example, lets take look at class Cheese, with the following fields: type, price, age and country. We can express some LHS condition in normal DRL like the following Cheese(age = [when][]is greater than=> [when][]is equal to=== [when][]equals=== [when][]There is a Cheese with=Cheese() [when][]- {field:\\w*} {operator} {value:\\d*}={field} {operator} {value} Given these DSL definitions, you can write rules with conditions such as: There is a Cheese with - age is less than 42 - rating is greater than 50 - type equals 'stilton' In this specific case, a phrase such as \"is less than\" is replaced by 50, type=='stilton') The order of the entries in the DSL is important if separate DSL expressions are intended to match the same line, one after the other. A good way to get started is to write representative samples of the rules your application requires, and to test them as you develop. This will provide you with a stable framework of conditional elements and their constraints. Rules, both in DRL and in DSLR, refer to entities according to the data model representing the application data that should be subject to the reasoning process defined in rules. Notice that writing rules is generally easier if most of the data model’s types are facts. Given an initial set of rules, it should be possible to identify recurring or similar code snippets and to mark variable parts as parameters. This provides reliable leads as to what might be a handy DSL entry. Also, make sure you have a full grasp of the jargon the domain experts are using, and base your DSL phrases on this vocabulary. You may postpone implementation decisions concerning conditions and actions during this first design phase by leaving certain conditional elements and actions in their DRL form by prefixing a line with a greater sign (\">\"). (This is also handy for inserting debugging statements.) During the next development phase, you should find that the DSL configuration stabilizes pretty quickly. New rules can be written by reusing the existing DSL definitions, or by adding a parameter to an existing condition or consequence entry. Try to keep the number of DSL entries small. Using parameters lets you apply the same DSL sentence for similar rule patterns or constraints. But do not exaggerate: authors using the DSL should still be able to identify DSL phrases by some fixed text. A DSL file is a text file in a line-oriented format. Its entries are used for transforming a DSLR file into a file according to DRL syntax. A line starting with \"#\" or \"//\" (with or without preceding white space) is treated as a comment. A comment line starting with \"#/\" is scanned for words requesting a debug option, see below. Any line starting with an opening bracket (\"[\") is assumed to be the first line of a DSL entry definition. Any other line is appended to the preceding DSL entry definition, with the line end replaced by a space. A DSL entry consists of the following four parts: A scope definition, written as one of the keywords \"when\" or \"condition\", \"then\" or \"consequence\", \"*\" and \"keyword\", enclosed in brackets (\"[\" and \"]\"). This indicates whether the DSL entry is valid for the condition or the consequence of a rule, or both. A scope indication of \"keyword\" means that the entry has global significance, i.e., it is recognized anywhere in a DSLR file. A type definition, written as a Java class name, enclosed in brackets. This part is optional unless the next part begins with an opening bracket. An empty pair of brackets is valid, too. A DSL expression consists of a (Java) regular expression, with any number of embedded variable definitions, terminated by an equal sign (\"=\"). A variable definition is enclosed in braces (\"{\" and \"}\"). It consists of a variable name and two optional attachments, separated by colons (\":\"). If there is one attachment, it is a regular expression for matching text that is to be assigned to the variable; if there are two attachments, the first one is a hint for the GUI editor and the second one the regular expression. Note that all characters that are \"magic\" in regular expressions must be escaped with a preceding backslash (\"\\\") if they should occur literally within the expression. The remaining part of the line after the delimiting equal sign is the replacement text for any DSLR text matching the regular expression. It may contain variable references, i.e., a variable name enclosed in braces. Optionally, the variable name may be followed by an exclamation mark (\"!\") and a transformation function, see below. Note that braces (\"{\" and \"}\") must be escaped with a preceding backslash (\"\\\") if they should occur literally within the replacement string. Debugging of DSL expansion can be turned on, selectively, by using a comment line starting with \"#/\" which may contain one or more words from the table presented below. The resulting output is written to standard output. Table 4. Debug options for DSL expansion Word Description result Prints the resulting DRL text, with line numbers. steps Prints each expansion step of condition and consequence lines. keyword Dumps the internal representation of all DSL entries with scope \"keyword\". when Dumps the internal representation of all DSL entries with scope \"when\" or \"*\". then Dumps the internal representation of all DSL entries with scope \"then\" or \"*\". usage Displays a usage statistic of all DSL entries. Below are some sample DSL definitions, with comments describing the language features they illustrate. # Comment: DSL examples #/ debug: display result and usage # keyword definition: replaces \"regula\" by \"rule\" [keyword][]regula=rule # conditional element: \"T\" or \"t\", \"a\" or \"an\", convert matched word [when][][Tt]here is an? {entity:\\w+}= ${entity!lc}: {entity!ucfirst} () # consequence statement: convert matched word, literal braces [then][]update {entity:\\w+}=modify( ${entity!lc} )\\{ \\} The transformation of a DSLR file proceeds as follows: The text is read into memory. Each of the \"keyword\" entries is applied to the entire text. First, the regular expression from the keyword definition is modified by replacing white space sequences with a pattern matching any number of white space characters, and by replacing variable definitions with a capture made from the regular expression provided with the definition, or with the default (\".*?\"). Then, the DSLR text is searched exhaustively for occurrences of strings matching the modified regular expression. Substrings of a matching string corresponding to variable captures are extracted and replace variable references in the corresponding replacement text, and this text replaces the matching string in the DSLR text. Sections of the DSLR text between \"when\" and \"then\", and \"then\" and \"end\", respectively, are located and processed in a uniform manner, line by line, as described below. For a line, each DSL entry pertaining to the line’s section is taken in turn, in the order it appears in the DSL file. Its regular expression part is modified: white space is replaced by a pattern matching any number of white space characters; variable definitions with a regular expression are replaced by a capture with this regular expression, its default being \".*?\". If the resulting regular expression matches all or part of the line, the matched part is replaced by the suitably modified replacement text. Modification of the replacement text is done by replacing variable references with the text corresponding to the regular expression capture. This text may be modified according to the string transformation function given in the variable reference; see below for details. If there is a variable reference naming a variable that is not defined in the same entry, the expander substitutes a value bound to a variable of that name, provided it was defined in one of the preceding lines of the current rule. If a DSLR line in a condition is written with a leading hyphen, the expanded result is inserted into the last line, which should contain a pattern CE, i.e., a type name followed by a pair of parentheses. if this pair is empty, the expanded line (which should contain a valid constraint) is simply inserted, otherwise a comma (\",\") is inserted beforehand. If a DSLR line in a consequence is written with a leading hyphen, the expanded result is inserted into the last line, which should contain a \"modify\" statement, ending in a pair of braces (\"{\" and \"}\"). If this pair is empty, the expanded line (which should contain a valid method call) is simply inserted, otherwise a comma (\",\") is inserted beforehand. It is currently not possible to use a line with a leading hyphen to insert text into other conditional element forms (e.g., \"accumulate\") or it may only work for the first insertion (e.g., \"eval\"). All string transformation functions are described in the following table. Table 5. String transformation functions Name Description uc Converts all letters to upper case. lc Converts all letters to lower case. ucfirst Converts the first letter to upper case, and all other letters to lower case. num Extracts all digits and \"-\" from the string. If the last two digits in the original string are preceded by \".\" or \",\", a decimal period is inserted in the corresponding position. a?b/c Compares the string with string a, and if they are equal, replaces it with b, otherwise with c. But c can be another triplet a, b, c, so that the entire structure is, in fact, a translation table. The following DSL examples show how to use string transformation functions. # definitions for conditions [when][]There is an? {entity}=${entity!lc}: {entity!ucfirst}() [when][]- with an? {attr} greater than {amount}={attr} 0/negative?%lt;0/zero?==0/ERROR} A file containing a DSL definition has to be put under the resources folder or any of its subfolders like any other drools artifact. It must have the extension .dsl, or alternatively be marked with type ResourceType.DSL. when programmatically added to a KieFileSystem. For a file using DSL definition, the extension .dslr should be used, while it can be added to a KieFileSystem with type ResourceType.DSLR. For parsing and expanding a DSLR file the DSL configuration is read and supplied to the parser. Thus, the parser can \"recognize\" the DSL expressions and transform them into native rule language expressions. Spreadsheet decision tables are XLS or XLSX spreadsheets that contain business rules defined in a tabular format. Each row in a decision table is a rule, and each column is a condition, an action, or another rule attribute. After you create and upload your spreadsheet decision tables, the rules you defined are compiled into Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules as with all other rule assets. All data objects related to a spreadsheet decision table must be in the same project package as the spreadsheet decision table. Assets in the same package are imported by default. Existing assets in other packages can be imported with the decision table. An online shopping site lists the shipping charges for ordered items. The site provides free shipping under the following conditions: The number of items ordered is 4 or more and the checkout total is $300 or more. Standard shipping is selected (4 or 5 business days from the date of purchase). The following are the shipping rates under these conditions: Table 6. For orders less than $300 Number of items Delivery day Shipping charge in USD, N = Number of items 3 or fewer Next day 2nd day Standard 35 15 10 4 or more Next day 2nd day Standard N*7.50 N*3.50 N*2.50 Table 7. For orders more than $300 Number of items Delivery day Shipping charge in USD, N = Number of items 3 or fewer Next day 2nd day Standard 25 10 N*1.50 4 or more Next day 2nd day Standard N*5 N*2 FREE These conditions and rates are shown in the following example spreadsheet decision table: Figure 26. Decision table for shipping charges In order for a decision table to be executed in Drools rule engine, the table must comply with certain structure and syntax requirements, within an XLS or XLSX spreadsheet, as shown in this example. For more information, see Defining spreadsheet decision tables. Spreadsheet decision tables (XLS or XLSX) require two key areas that define rule data: a RuleSet area and a RuleTable area. The RuleSet area of the spreadsheet defines elements that you want to apply globally to all rules in the same package (not only the spreadsheet), such as a rule set name or universal rule attributes. The RuleTable area defines the actual rules (rows) and the conditions, actions, and other rule attributes (columns) that constitute that rule table within the specified rule set. A spreadsheet of decision tables can contain multiple RuleTable areas, but only one RuleSet area. Starting with Drools v8, file extension must end in either .drl.xls, .drl.xlsx, or .drl.csv as mentioned in the Release Notes. You should typically write only one spreadsheet of decision tables, containing all necessary RuleTable definitions, per rule package. You can write separate decision table spreadsheets for separate packages, but writing multiple spreadsheets in the same package can cause compilation errors from conflicting RuleSet or RuleTable attributes and is therefore not recommended. Refer to the following sample spreadsheet as you define your decision table: Figure 27. Sample spreadsheet decision table for shipping charges Procedure In a new XLS or XLSX spreadsheet, go to the second or third column and label a cell RuleSet (row 1 in example). Reserve the column or columns to the left for descriptive metadata (optional). In the next cell to the right, enter a name for the RuleSet. This named rule set will contain all RuleTable rules defined in the rule package. Under the RuleSet cell, define any rule attributes (one per cell) that you want to apply globally to all rule tables in the package. Specify attribute values in the cells to the right. For example, you can enter an Import label and in the cell to the right, specify relevant data objects from other packages that you want to import into the package for the decision table (in the format package.name.object.name). For supported cell labels and values, see RuleSet definitions. Below the RuleSet area and in the same column as the RuleSet cell, skip a row and label a new cell RuleTable (row 7 in example) and enter a table name in the same cell. The name is used as the initial part of the name for all rules derived from this rule table, with the row number appended for distinction. You can override this automatic naming by inserting a NAME attribute column. Use the next four rows to define the following elements as needed (rows 8-11 in example): Rule attributes: Conditions, actions, or other attributes. For supported cell labels and values, see RuleTable definitions. Object types: The data objects to which the rule attributes apply. If the same object type applies to multiple columns, merge the object cells into one cell across multiple columns (as shown in the sample decision table), instead of repeating the object type in multiple cells. When an object type is merged, all columns below the merged range will be combined into one set of constraints within a single pattern for matching a single fact at a time. When an object is repeated in separate columns, the separate columns can create different patterns, potentially matching different or identical facts. Constraints: Constraints on the object types. Column label: (Optional) Any descriptive label for the column, as a visual aid. Leave blank if unused. As an alternative to populating both the object type and constraint cells, you can leave the object type cell or cells empty and enter the full expression in the corresponding constraint cell or cells. For example, instead of Order as the object type and itemsCount > $1 as a constraint (separate cells), you can leave the object type cell empty and enter Order( itemsCount > $1 ) in the constraint cell, and then do the same for other constraint cells. After you have defined all necessary rule attributes (columns), enter values for each column as needed, row by row, to generate rules (rows 12-17 in example). Cells with no data are ignored (such as when a condition or action does not apply). If you need to add more rule tables to this decision table spreadsheet, skip a row after the last rule in the previous table, label another RuleTable cell in the same column as the previous RuleTable and RuleSet cells, and create the new table following the same steps in this section (rows 19-29 in example). Save your XLS or XLSX spreadsheet to finish. By default, only the first worksheet in a spreadsheet workbook is processed as a decision table. Each RuleSet name combined with the RuleTable name must be unique across all decision table files in the same package. If you want to process multiple worksheet decision tables, then create a .properties file with the same name as the spreadsheet workbook. The .properties file must contain a property sheet with comma-separated values (CSV) for the names of the worksheets, for example: sheets=Sheet1,Sheet2 After Drools rule engine loads the decision table, the rules are internally rendered as DRL rules like the following example, from the sample spreadsheet: //row 12 rule \"Basic_12\" salience 10 when $order : Order( itemsCount > 0, itemsCount $1 as a constraint (separate cells), you can leave the object type cell empty and enter Order( itemsCount > $1 ) in the constraint cell, and then do the same for any other constraint cells. To include a pattern without constraints, you can write the pattern in front of the text of another pattern, with or without an empty pair of parentheses. You can also append a from clause to the pattern. If the pattern ends with eval, code snippets produce boolean expressions for inclusion into a pair of parentheses after eval. You can terminate the pattern with @watch annotation, which is used to customize the properties that the pattern is reactive on. Second cell: Text in the second cell below CONDITION is processed as a constraint on the object reference in the first cell. The code snippet in this cell is modified by interpolating values from cells farther down in the column. If you want to create a constraint consisting of a comparison using == with the value from the cells below, then the field selector alone is sufficient. If you use the field selector alone, but you want to use the condition as it is without appending any == comparison, you must terminate the condition with the symbol ?. Any other comparison operator must be specified as the last item within the snippet, and the value from the cells below is appended. For all other constraint forms, you must mark the position for including the contents of a cell with the symbol $param. Multiple insertions are possible if you use the symbols $1, $2, and so on, and a comma-separated list of values in the cells below. However, do not separate $1, $2, and so on, by commas, or the table will fail to process. To expand a text according to the pattern forall($delimiter){$snippet}, repeat the $snippet once for each of the values of the comma-separated list in each of the cells below, insert the value in place of the symbol $, and join these expansions by the given $delimiter. Note that the forall construct may be surrounded by other text. If the first cell contains an object, the completed code snippet is added to the conditional element from that cell. A pair of parentheses is provided automatically, as well as a separating comma if multiple constraints are added to a pattern in a merged cell. If the first cell is empty, the code snippet in this cell must result in a valid conditional element on its own. For example, instead of Order as the object type and itemsCount > $1 as a constraint (separate cells), you can leave the object type cell empty and enter Order( itemsCount > $1 ) in the constraint cell, and then do the same for any other constraint cells. Third cell: Text in the third cell below CONDITION is a descriptive label that you define for the column, as a visual aid. Fourth cell: From the fourth row on, non-blank entries provide data for interpolation. A blank cell omits the condition or constraint for this rule. Actions For columns headed ACTION, the cells in consecutive lines result in an action statement: First cell: Text in the first cell below ACTION is optional. If present, the text is interpreted as an object reference. Second cell: Text in the second cell below ACTION is a code snippet that is modified by interpolating values from cells farther down in the column. For a singular insertion, mark the position for including the contents of a cell with the symbol $param. Multiple insertions are possible if you use the symbols $1, $2, and so on, and a comma-separated list of values in the cells below. However, do not separate $1, $2, and so on, by commas, or the table will fail to process. A text without any marker symbols can execute a method call without interpolation. In this case, use any non-blank entry in a row below the cell to include the statement. The forall construct is supported. If the first cell contains an object, then the cell text (followed by a period), the text in the second cell, and a terminating semicolon are strung together, resulting in a method call that is added as an action statement for the consequence. If the first cell is empty, the code snippet in this cell must result in a valid action element on its own. Third cell: Text in the third cell below ACTION is a descriptive label that you define for the column, as a visual aid. Fourth cell: From the fourth row on, non-blank entries provide data for interpolation. A blank cell omits the condition or constraint for this rule. Metadata For columns headed METADATA, the cells in consecutive lines result in a metadata annotation for the generated rules: First cell: Text in the first cell below METADATA is ignored. Second cell: Text in the second cell below METADATA is subject to interpolation, using values from the cells in the rule rows. The metadata marker character @ is prefixed automatically, so you do not need to include that character in the text for this cell. Third cell: Text in the third cell below METADATA is a descriptive label that you define for the column, as a visual aid. Fourth cell: From the fourth row on, non-blank entries provide data for interpolation. A blank cell results in the omission of the metadata annotation for this rule. The RuleSet and RuleTable areas also support labels and values for other rule attributes, such as PRIORITY or NO-LOOP. Rule attributes specified in a RuleSet area will affect all rule assets in the same package (not only in the spreadsheet). Rule attributes specified in a RuleTable area will affect only the rules in that rule table. You can use each rule attribute only once in a RuleSet area and once in a RuleTable area. If the same attribute is used in both RuleSet and RuleTable areas within the spreadsheet, then RuleTable takes priority and the attribute in the RuleSet area is overridden. The following table lists the supported labels (column headers) and values for additional RuleSet or RuleTable definitions. For column headers, you can use either the given labels or any custom labels that begin with the letters listed in the table. Table 10. Additional rule attributes for RuleSet or RuleTable definitions Label Or custom label that begins with Value PRIORITY P An integer defining the salience value of the rule. Rules with a higher salience value are given higher priority when ordered in the internalMatch queue. Overridden by the Sequential flag. Example: PRIORITY 10 DATE-EFFECTIVE V A string containing a date and time definition. The rule can be activated only if the current date and time is after a DATE-EFFECTIVE attribute. Example: DATE-EFFECTIVE \"4-Sep-2018\" DATE-EXPIRES Z A string containing a date and time definition. The rule cannot be activated if the current date and time is after the DATE-EXPIRES attribute. Example: DATE-EXPIRES \"4-Oct-2018\" NO-LOOP U A Boolean value. When this option is set to true, the rule cannot be reactivated (looped) if a consequence of the rule re-triggers a previously met condition. Example: NO-LOOP true AGENDA-GROUP G A string identifying an agenda group to which you want to assign the rule. Agenda groups allow you to partition the agenda to provide more execution control over groups of rules. Only rules in an agenda group that has acquired a focus are able to be activated. Example: AGENDA-GROUP \"GroupName\" ACTIVATION-GROUP X A string identifying an internalMatch (or XOR) group to which you want to assign the rule. In internalMatch groups, only one rule can be activated. The first rule to fire will cancel all pending internalMatches of all rules in the internalMatch group. Example: ACTIVATION-GROUP \"GroupName\" DURATION D A long integer value defining the duration of time in milliseconds after which the rule can be activated, if the rule conditions are still met. Example: DURATION 10000 TIMER T A string identifying either int (interval) or cron timer definitions for scheduling the rule. Example: TIMER \"*/5 * * * *\" (every 5 minutes) CALENDAR E A Quartz calendar definition for scheduling the rule. Example: CALENDAR \"* * 0-7,18-23 ? * *\" (exclude non-business hours) AUTO-FOCUS F A Boolean value, applicable only to rules within agenda groups. When this option is set to true, the next time the rule is activated, a focus is automatically given to the agenda group to which the rule is assigned. Example: AUTO-FOCUS true LOCK-ON-ACTIVE L A Boolean value, applicable only to rules within rule flow groups or agenda groups. When this option is set to true, the next time the ruleflow group for the rule becomes active or the agenda group for the rule receives a focus, the rule cannot be activated again until the ruleflow group is no longer active or the agenda group loses the focus. This is a stronger version of the no-loop attribute, because the internalMatch of a matching rule is discarded regardless of the origin of the update (not only by the rule itself). This attribute is ideal for calculation rules where you have a number of rules that modify a fact and you do not want any rule re-matching and firing again. Example: LOCK-ON-ACTIVE true RULEFLOW-GROUP R A string identifying a rule flow group. In rule flow groups, rules can fire only when the group is activated by the associated rule flow. Example: RULEFLOW-GROUP \"GroupName\" Figure 28. Sample decision table spreadsheet with attribute columns The various interpolations of data in decision tables are illustrated in the following example. Example 5. Interpolating cell data If the template is Foo(bar == $param) and the cell is 42, then the result is Foo(bar == 42). If the template is Foo(bar 60) { return true; } else { return false; } } Multiple package names within the same cell must be separated by a comma. Also, the pairs of type and variable names must be comma-separated. Functions, however, must be written as they appear in a DRL file. This should appear in the same column as the \"RuleSet\" keyword; it could be above, between, or below all the rule rows. It may be more convenient to use Import, Variables, Functions and Queries repeatedly rather than packing several definitions into a single cell. The API to use spreadsheet decision tables is in the drools-decisiontables module. When including drools-decisiontables in your project, you might encounter the following error: ERROR StatusLogger Log4j2 could not find a logging implementation; this happens because the underlying library to process spreadsheet files Apache POI uses the Log4j API (reference). To avoid that error, you must include either the SLF4J adapter or the Log4j 2 SLF4J Binding, depending on whether your project is using Log4j as a logging backend. There is only one class to look at: SpreadsheetCompiler. This class will take spreadsheets in various formats, and generate rules in DRL (which you can then use in the normal way). The SpreadsheetCompiler can just be used to generate partial rule files if it is wished and assemble them into a complete rule package after the fact (this allows the separation of technical and non-technical aspects of the rules if needed). Spreadsheets are well-established business tools (in use for over 25 years). Decision tables lend themselves to close collaboration between IT and domain experts while making the business rules clear to business analysts, it is an ideal separation of concerns. Typically, the whole process of authoring rules (coming up with a new decision table) would be something like: A business analyst takes a template decision table (from a repository, or IT) Decision table business language descriptions are entered in the table(s) Decision table rules (rows) are entered (roughly) A decision table is handed to a technical resource, who maps the business language (descriptions) to scripts (this may involve software development of course if it is a new application or data model) The technical person hands back and reviews the modifications with the business analyst. The business analyst can continue editing the rule rows as needed (moving columns around is also fine etc). In parallel, the technical person can develop test cases for the rules (liaising with business analysts) as these test cases can be used to verify rules and rule changes once the system is running. Features of applications like Excel can be used to provide assistance in entering data into spreadsheets, such as validating fields. Lists that are stored in other worksheets can be used to provide valid lists of values for cells, like in the following diagram. Some applications provide a limited ability to keep a history of changes, but it is recommended to use an alternative means of revision control. When changes are being made to rules over time, older versions are archived (many open source solutions exist for this, such as Subversion or Git). DRT (Drools Rule Template) is deprecated. Please consider this decision table capability or third party templating features if needed.","title":"Rule Language

explains the traditional DRL syntax. This syntax can be used instead of the RuleUnit and OOPath based syntax. The traditional syntax is still fully supported. A package is a folder of related assets in Drools, such as data objects, DRL files, decision tables, and other asset types. A package also serves as a unique namespace for each group of rules. A single rule base can contain multiple packages. You typically store all the rules for a package in the same file as the package declaration so that the package is self-contained. However, you can import objects from other packages that you want to use in the rules. The following example is a package name and namespace for a DRL file in a mortgage application decision service: Example package definition in a DRL file package org.mortgages; The following railroad diagram shows all the components that may make up a package: Figure 1. Package Note that a package must have a namespace and be declared using standard Java conventions for package names; i.e., no spaces, unlike rule names which allow spaces. In terms of the order of elements, they can appear in any order in the rule file, with the exception of the package statement, which must be at the top of the file. In all cases, the semicolons are optional. Notice that any rule attribute (as described the section Rule Attributes) may also be written at package level, superseding the attribute’s default value. The modified default may still be replaced by an attribute setting within a rule. Figure 2. Import Similar to import statements in Java, imports in DRL files identify the fully qualified paths and type names for any objects that you want to use in the rules. You specify the package and data object in the format packageName.objectName, with multiple imports on separate lines. The Drools rule engine automatically imports classes from the Java package with the same name as the DRL package and from the package java.lang. The following example is an import statement for a loan application object in a mortgage application decision service: Example import statement in a DRL file import org.mortgages.LoanApplication; Figure 3. Function Functions in DRL files put semantic code in your rule source file instead of in Java classes. Functions are especially useful if an action (then) part of a rule is used repeatedly and only the parameters differ for each rule. Above the rules in the DRL file, you can declare the function or import a static method from a helper class as a function, and then use the function by name in an action (then) part of the rule. The following examples illustrate a function that is either declared or an imported static method in a DRL file: Example function declaration with a rule (option 1) function String hello(String applicantName) { return \"Hello \" + applicantName + \"!\"; } rule \"Using a function\" when // Empty then System.out.println( hello( \"James\" ) ); end Example import a static method of a Java class (option 2) package org.example.applicant; public class MyFunctions { public static String hello(String applicantName) { return \"Hello \" + applicantName + \"!\"; } } import static org.example.applicant.MyFunctions.hello; rule \"Using a function\" when // Empty then System.out.println( hello( \"James\" ) ); end A function declared in a DRL file cannot be imported to a rule in a different package while a Java static method in a different package can be imported. Figure 4. Query Queries in DRL files search the working memory of the Drools rule engine for facts related to the rules in the DRL file. You add the query definitions in DRL files and then obtain the matching results in your application code. Queries search for a set of defined conditions and do not require when or then specifications. Query names are global to the KIE base and therefore must be unique among all other rule queries in the project. To return the results of a query, you construct a QueryResults definition using ksession.getQueryResults(\"name\"), where \"name\" is the query name. This returns a list of query results, which enable you to retrieve the objects that matched the query. You define the query and query results parameters above the rules in the DRL file. The following example is a query definition in a DRL file for underage applicants in a mortgage application decision service, with the accompanying application code: Example query definition in a DRL file query \"people under the age of 21\" $person : Person( age >(); for ( QueryResultsRow r : results ) { l.add( Arrays.asList( new String[] { (String) r.get( \"x\" ), (String) r.get( \"y\" ) } ) ); } The algorithm uses stacks to handle recursion, so the method stack will not blow up. It is also possible to use as input argument for a query both the field of a fact as in: query contains(String $s, String $c) $s := String( this.contains( $c ) ) end rule PersonNamesWithA when $p : Person() contains( $p.name, \"a\"; ) then end and more in general any kind of valid expression like in: query checkLength(String $s, int $l) $s := String( length == $l ) end rule CheckPersonNameLength when $i : Integer() $p : Person() checkLength( $p.name, 1 + $i + $p.age; ) then end The following is not yet supported: List and Map unification Expression unification - pred( X, X + 1, X * Y / 7 ) Figure 5. Type declaration Figure 6. Metadata Declarations in DRL files define new fact types or metadata for fact types to be used by rules in the DRL file: New fact types: The default fact type in the java.lang package of Drools is Object, but you can declare other types in DRL files as needed. Declaring fact types in DRL files enables you to define a new fact model directly in the Drools rule engine, without creating models in a lower-level language like Java. You can also declare a new type when a domain model is already built and you want to complement this model with additional entities that are used mainly during the reasoning process. Metadata for fact types: You can associate metadata in the format @key(value) with new or existing facts. Metadata can be any kind of data that is not represented by the fact attributes and is consistent among all instances of that fact type. The metadata can be queried at run time by the Drools rule engine and used in the reasoning process. A declaration of a new fact does not require any metadata, but must include a list of attributes or fields. If a type declaration does not include identifying attributes, the Drools rule engine searches for an existing fact class in the classpath and raises an error if the class is missing. The following example is a declaration of a new fact type Person with no metadata in a DRL file: Example declaration of a new fact type with a rule declare Person name : String dateOfBirth : java.util.Date address : Address end rule \"Using a declared type\" when $p : Person( name == \"James\" ) then // Insert Mark, who is a customer of James. Person mark = new Person(); mark.setName( \"Mark\" ); insert( mark ); end In this example, the new fact type Person has the three attributes name, dateOfBirth, and address. Each attribute has a type that can be any valid Java type, including another class that you create or a fact type that you previously declared. The dateOfBirth attribute has the type java.util.Date, from the Java API, and the address attribute has the previously defined fact type Address. To avoid writing the fully qualified name of a class every time you declare it, you can define the full class name as part of the import clause: Example type declaration with the fully qualified class name in the import import java.util.Date declare Person name : String dateOfBirth : Date address : Address end When you declare a new fact type, the Drools rule engine generates at compile time a Java class representing the fact type. The generated Java class is a one-to-one JavaBeans mapping of the type definition. For example, the following Java class is generated from the example Person type declaration: Generated Java class for the Person fact type declaration public class Person implements Serializable { private String name; private java.util.Date dateOfBirth; private Address address; // Empty constructor public Person() {...} // Constructor with all fields public Person( String name, Date dateOfBirth, Address address ) {...} // If keys are defined, constructor with keys public Person( ...keys... ) {...} // Getters and setters // `equals` and `hashCode` // `toString` } You can then use the generated class in your rules like any other fact, as illustrated in the previous rule example with the Person type declaration: Example rule that uses the declared Person fact type rule \"Using a declared type\" when $p : Person( name == \"James\" ) then // Insert Mark, who is a customer of James. Person mark = new Person(); mark.setName( \"Mark\" ); insert( mark ); end DRL supports the declaration of enumerative types in the format declare enum , followed by a comma-separated list of values ending with a semicolon. You can then use the enumerative list in the rules in the DRL file. For example, the following enumerative type declaration defines days of the week for an employee scheduling rule: Example enumerative type declaration with a scheduling rule declare enum DaysOfWeek SUN(\"Sunday\"),MON(\"Monday\"),TUE(\"Tuesday\"),WED(\"Wednesday\"),THU(\"Thursday\"),FRI(\"Friday\"),SAT(\"Saturday\"); fullName : String end rule \"Using a declared Enum\" when $emp : Employee( dayOff == DaysOfWeek.MON ) then ... end DRL supports type declaration inheritance in the format declare extends . To extend a type declared in Java by a subtype declared in DRL, you repeat the parent type in a declaration statement without any fields. For example, the following type declarations extend a Student type from a top-level Person type, and a LongTermStudent type from the Student subtype: Example extended type declarations import org.people.Person declare Person end declare Student extends Person school : String end declare LongTermStudent extends Student years : int course : String end You can associate metadata in the format @key(value) (the value is optional) with fact types or fact attributes. Metadata can be any kind of data that is not represented by the fact attributes and is consistent among all instances of that fact type. The metadata can be queried at run time by the Drools rule engine and used in the reasoning process. Any metadata that you declare before the attributes of a fact type are assigned to the fact type, while metadata that you declare after an attribute are assigned to that particular attribute. In the following example, the two metadata attributes @author and @dateOfCreation are declared for the Person fact type, and the two metadata items @key and @maxLength are declared for the name attribute. The @key metadata attribute has no required value, so the parentheses and the value are omitted. Example metadata declaration for fact types and attributes import java.util.Date declare Person @author( Bob ) @dateOfCreation( 01-Feb-2009 ) name : String @key @maxLength( 30 ) dateOfBirth : Date address : Address end For declarations of metadata attributes for existing types, you can identify the fully qualified class name as part of the import clause for all declarations or as part of the individual declare clause: Example metadata declaration for an imported type import org.drools.examples.Person declare Person @author( Bob ) @dateOfCreation( 01-Feb-2009 ) end Example metadata declaration for a declared type declare org.drools.examples.Person @author( Bob ) @dateOfCreation( 01-Feb-2009 ) end The examples in this section that refer to the VoiceCall class assume that the sample application domain model includes the following class details: VoiceCall fact class in an example Telecom domain model public class VoiceCall { private String originNumber; private String destinationNumber; private Date callDateTime; private long callDuration; // in milliseconds // Constructors, getters, and setters } @role This tag determines whether a given fact type is handled as a regular fact or an event in the Drools rule engine during complex event processing. Default parameter: fact Supported parameters: fact, event @role( fact | event ) Example: Declare VoiceCall as event type declare VoiceCall @role( event ) end @timestamp This tag is automatically assigned to every event in the Drools rule engine. By default, the time is provided by the session clock and assigned to the event when it is inserted into the working memory of the Drools rule engine. You can specify a custom time stamp attribute instead of the default time stamp added by the session clock. Default parameter: The time added by the Drools rule engine session clock Supported parameters: Session clock time or custom time stamp attribute @timestamp( ) Example: Declare VoiceCall timestamp attribute declare VoiceCall @role( event ) @timestamp( callDateTime ) end @duration This tag determines the duration time for events in the Drools rule engine. Events can be interval-based events or point-in-time events. Interval-based events have a duration time and persist in the working memory of the Drools rule engine until their duration time has lapsed. Point-in-time events have no duration and are essentially interval-based events with a duration of zero. By default, every event in the Drools rule engine has a duration of zero. You can specify a custom duration attribute instead of the default. Default parameter: Null (zero) Supported parameters: Custom duration attribute @duration( ) Example: Declare VoiceCall duration attribute declare VoiceCall @role( event ) @timestamp( callDateTime ) @duration( callDuration ) end @expires This tag determines the time duration before an event expires in the working memory of the Drools rule engine. By default, an event expires when the event can no longer match and activate any of the current rules. You can define an amount of time after which an event should expire. This tag definition also overrides the implicit expiration offset calculated from temporal constraints and sliding windows in the KIE base. This tag is available only when the Drools rule engine is running in stream mode. Default parameter: Null (event expires after event can no longer match and activate rules) Supported parameters: Custom timeOffset attribute in the format [#d][#h][#m][#s][[ms]] @expires( ) Example: Declare expiration offset for VoiceCall events declare VoiceCall @role( event ) @timestamp( callDateTime ) @duration( callDuration ) @expires( 1h35m ) end Declared types in DRL are typically used within the DRL files while Java models are typically used when the model is shared between rules and applications. Because declared types are generated at KIE base compile time, an application cannot access them until application run time. In some cases, an application needs to access and handle facts directly from the declared types, especially when the application wraps the Drools rule engine and provides higher-level, domain-specific user interfaces for rules management. To handle declared types directly from the application code, you can use the org.drools.definition.type.FactType API in Drools. Through this API, you can instantiate, read, and write fields in the declared fact types. The following example code modifies a Person fact type directly from an application: Example application code to handle a declared fact type through the FactType API import java.util.Date; import org.kie.api.definition.type.FactType; import org.kie.api.KieBase; import org.kie.api.runtime.KieSession; ... // Get a reference to a KIE base with the declared type: KieBase kbase = ... // Get the declared fact type: FactType personType = kbase.getFactType(\"org.drools.examples\", \"Person\"); // Create instances: Object bob = personType.newInstance(); // Set attribute values: personType.set(bob, \"name\", \"Bob\" ); personType.set(bob, \"dateOfBirth\", new Date()); personType.set(bob, \"address\", new Address(\"King's Road\",\"London\",\"404\")); // Insert the fact into a KIE session: KieSession ksession = ... ksession.insert(bob); ksession.fireAllRules(); // Read attributes: String name = (String) personType.get(bob, \"name\"); Date date = (Date) personType.get(bob, \"dateOfBirth\"); The API also includes other helpful methods, such as setting all the attributes at once, reading values from a Map collection, or reading all attributes at once into a Map collection. Although the API behavior is similar to Java reflection, the API does not use reflection and relies on more performant accessors that are implemented with generated bytecode. Figure 7. Global Global variables in DRL files typically provide data or services for the rules, such as application services used in rule consequences, and return data from rules, such as logs or values added in rule consequences. You set the global value in the working memory of the Drools rule engine through a KIE session configuration or REST operation, declare the global variable above the rules in the DRL file, and then use it in an action (then) part of the rule. For multiple global variables, use separate lines in the DRL file. The following example illustrates a global variable list configuration for the Drools rule engine and the corresponding global variable definition in the DRL file: Example global list configuration for the Drools rule engine List list = new ArrayList<>(); KieSession kieSession = kiebase.newKieSession(); kieSession.setGlobal( \"myGlobalList\", list ); Example global variable definition with a rule global java.util.List myGlobalList; rule \"Using a global\" when // Empty then myGlobalList.add( \"My global list\" ); end Do not use global variables to establish conditions in rules unless a global variable has a constant immutable value. Global variables are not inserted into the working memory of the Drools rule engine, so the Drools rule engine cannot track value changes of variables. Do not use global variables to share data between rules. Rules always reason and react to the working memory state, so if you want to pass data from rule to rule, assert the data as facts into the working memory of the Drools rule engine. A use case for a global variable might be an instance of an email service. In your integration code that is calling the Drools rule engine, you obtain your emailService object and then set it in the working memory of the Drools rule engine. In the DRL file, you declare that you have a global of type emailService and give it the name \"email\", and then in your rule consequences, you can use actions such as email.sendSMS(number, message). If you declare global variables with the same identifier in multiple packages, then you must set all the packages with the same type so that they all reference the same global value. Timers and calendars are DRL rule attributes that enable you to apply scheduling and timing constraints to your DRL rules. These attributes require additional configurations depending on the use case. The timer attribute in DRL rules is a string identifying either int (interval) or cron timer definitions for scheduling a rule and supports the following formats: Timer attribute formats timer ( int: ) timer ( cron: ) Example interval timer attributes // Run after a 30-second delay timer ( int: 30s ) // Run every 5 minutes after a 30-second delay each time timer ( int: 30s 5m ) Example cron timer attribute // Run every 15 minutes timer ( cron:* 0/15 * * * ? ) Interval timers follow the semantics of java.util.Timer objects, with an initial delay and an optional repeat interval. Cron timers follow standard Unix cron expressions. The following example DRL rule uses a cron timer to send an SMS text message every 15 minutes: Example DRL rule with a cron timer rule \"Send SMS message every 15 minutes\" timer ( cron:* 0/15 * * * ? ) when $a : Alarm( on == true ) then channels[ \"sms\" ].insert( new Sms( $a.mobileNumber, \"The alarm is still on.\" ); end Generally, a rule that is controlled by a timer becomes active when the rule is triggered and the rule consequence is executed repeatedly, according to the timer settings. The execution stops when the rule condition no longer matches incoming facts. However, the way the Drools rule engine handles rules with timers depends on whether the Drools rule engine is in active mode or in passive mode. By default, the Drools rule engine runs in passive mode and evaluates rules, according to the defined timer settings, when a user or an application explicitly calls fireAllRules(). Conversely, if a user or application calls fireUntilHalt(), the Drools rule engine starts in active mode and evaluates rules continually until the user or application explicitly calls halt(). When the Drools rule engine is in active mode, rule consequences are executed even after control returns from a call to fireUntilHalt() and the Drools rule engine remains reactive to any changes made to the working memory. For example, removing a fact that was involved in triggering the timer rule execution causes the repeated execution to terminate, and inserting a fact so that some rule matches causes that rule to be executed. However, the Drools rule engine is not continually active, but is active only after a rule is executed. Therefore, the Drools rule engine does not react to asynchronous fact insertions until the next execution of a timer-controlled rule. Disposing a KIE session terminates all timer activity. When the Drools rule engine is in passive mode, rule consequences of timed rules are evaluated only when fireAllRules() is invoked again. However, you can change the default timer-execution behavior in passive mode by configuring the KIE session with a TimedRuleExecutionOption option, as shown in the following example: KIE session configuration to automatically execute timed rules in passive mode KieSessionConfiguration ksconf = KieServices.Factory.get().newKieSessionConfiguration(); ksconf.setOption( TimedRuleExecutionOption.YES ); KSession ksession = kbase.newKieSession(ksconf, null); You can additionally set a FILTERED specification on the TimedRuleExecutionOption option that enables you to define a callback to filter those rules, as shown in the following example: KIE session configuration to filter which timed rules are automatically executed KieSessionConfiguration ksconf = KieServices.Factory.get().newKieSessionConfiguration(); conf.setOption( new TimedRuleExecutionOption.FILTERED(new TimedRuleExecutionFilter() { public boolean accept(Rule[] rules) { return rules[0].getName().equals(\"MyRule\"); } }) ); For interval timers, you can also use an expression timer with expr instead of int to define both the delay and interval as an expression instead of a fixed value. The following example DRL file declares a fact type with a delay and period that are then used in the subsequent rule with an expression timer: Example rule with an expression timer declare Bean delay : String = \"30s\" period : long = 60000 end rule \"Expression timer\" timer ( expr: $d, $p ) when Bean( $d : delay, $p : period ) then // Actions end The expressions, such as $d and $p in this example, can use any variable defined in the pattern-matching part of the rule. The variable can be any String value that can be parsed into a time duration or any numeric value that is internally converted in a long value for a duration in milliseconds. Both interval and expression timers can use the following optional parameters: start and end: A Date or a String representing a Date or a long value. The value can also be a Number that is transformed into a Java Date in the format new Date( ((Number) n).longValue() ). repeat-limit: An integer that defines the maximum number of repetitions allowed by the timer. If both the end and the repeat-limit parameters are set, the timer stops when the first of the two is reached. Example timer attribute with optional start, end, and repeat-limit parameters timer (int: 30s 1h; start=3-JAN-2020, end=4-JAN-2020, repeat-limit=50) In this example, the rule is scheduled for every hour, after a delay of 30 seconds each hour, beginning on 3 January 2020 and ending either on 4 January 2020 or when the cycle repeats 50 times. If the system is paused (for example, the session is serialized and then later deserialized), the rule is scheduled only one time to recover from missing activations regardless of how many activations were missed during the pause, and then the rule is subsequently scheduled again to continue in sync with the timer setting. The calendar attribute in DRL rules is a Quartz calendar definition for scheduling a rule and supports the following format: Calendar attribute format calendars \"\" Example calendar attributes // Exclude non-business hours calendars \"* * 0-7,18-23 ? * *\" // Weekdays only, as registered in the KIE session calendars \"weekday\" You can adapt a Quartz calendar based on the Quartz calendar API and then register the calendar in the KIE session, as shown in the following example: Adapting a Quartz Calendar Calendar weekDayCal = QuartzHelper.quartzCalendarAdapter(org.quartz.Calendar quartzCal) Registering the calendar in the KIE session ksession.getCalendars().set( \"weekday\", weekDayCal ); You can use calendars with standard rules and with rules that use timers. The calendar attribute can contain one or more comma-separated calendar names written as String literals. The following example rules use both calendars and timers to schedule the rules: Example rules with calendars and timers rule \"Weekdays are high priority\" calendars \"weekday\" timer ( int:0 1h ) when Alarm() then send( \"priority high - we have an alarm\" ); end rule \"Weekends are low priority\" calendars \"weekend\" timer ( int:0 4h ) when Alarm() then send( \"priority low - we have an alarm\" ); end Figure 8. Rule Figure 9. Conditional element in a rule The when part of a DRL rule (also known as the Left Hand Side (LHS) of the rule) contains the conditions that must be met to execute an action. Conditions consist of a series of stated patterns and constraints, with optional bindings and supported rule condition elements (keywords), based on the available data objects in the package. For example, if a bank requires loan applicants to have over 21 years of age, then the when condition of an \"Underage\" rule would be Applicant( age 100 && ( age % 10 == 0 ) ) You can also reuse Java methods in constraints, as shown in the following example: Example constraints with reused Java methods Person( Math.round( weight / ( height * height ) ) 50, weight > 80 ) // Person is more than 50 years old, weighs more than 80 kilograms, and is taller than 2 meters: Person( age > 50, weight > 80, height > 2 ) Although the && and , operators have the same semantics, they are resolved with different priorities. The && operator precedes the || operator, and both the && and || operators together precede the , operator. Use the comma operator at the top-level constraint for optimal Drools rule engine performance and human readability. You cannot embed a comma operator in a composite constraint expression, such as in parentheses: Example of misused comma in composite constraint expression // Do not use the following format: Person( ( age > 50, weight > 80 ) || height > 2 ) // Use the following format instead: Person( ( age > 50 && weight > 80 ) || height > 2 ) You can bind variables to patterns and constraints to refer to matched objects in other portions of a rule. Bound variables can help you define rules more efficiently or more consistently with how you annotate facts in your data model. To differentiate more easily between variables and fields in a rule, use the standard format $variable for variables, especially in complex rules. This convention is helpful but not required in DRL. For example, the following DRL rule uses the variable $p for a pattern with the Person fact: Pattern with a bound variable rule \"simple rule\" when $p : Person() then System.out.println( \"Person \" + $p ); end Similarly, you can also bind variables to properties in pattern constraints, as shown in the following example: // Two persons of the same age: Person( $firstAge : age ) // Binding Person( age == $firstAge ) // Constraint expression Constraint binding considers only the first atomic expression that follows it. In the following example the pattern only binds the age of the person to the variable $a: Person( $a : age * 2 ) for more readable rules, as shown in the following example: Example pattern with grouped constraints Person( name == \"mark\", address.( city == \"london\", country == \"uk\") ) The period prefix . differentiates the nested object constraints from a method call. When you work with nested objects in patterns, you can use the syntax # to cast to a subtype and make the getters from the parent type available to the subtype. You can use either the object name or fully qualified class name, and you can cast to one or multiple subtypes, as shown in the following examples: Example patterns with inline casting to a subtype // Inline casting with subtype name: Person( name == \"mark\", address#LongAddress.country == \"uk\" ) // Inline casting with fully qualified class name: Person( name == \"mark\", address#org.domain.LongAddress.country == \"uk\" ) // Multiple inline casts: Person( name == \"mark\", address#LongAddress.country#DetailedCountry.population > 10000000 ) These example patterns cast Address to LongAddress, and additionally to DetailedCountry in the last example, making the parent getters available to the subtypes in each case. You can use the instanceof operator to infer the results of the specified type in subsequent uses of that field with the pattern, as shown in the following example: Person( name == \"mark\", address instanceof LongAddress, address.country == \"uk\" ) If an inline cast is not possible (for example, if instanceof returns false), the evaluation is considered false. By default, the Drools rule engine supports the date format dd-mmm-yyyy. You can customize the date format, including a time format mask if needed, by providing an alternative format mask with the system property drools.dateformat=\"dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm\". You can also customize the date format by changing the language locale with the drools.defaultlanguage and drools.defaultcountry system properties (for example, the locale of Thailand is set as drools.defaultlanguage=th and drools.defaultcountry=TH). Example pattern with a date literal restriction Person( bornBefore 10000000 ) !. Use this operator to dereference a property in a null-safe way. The value to the left of the !. operator must be not null (interpreted as != null) in order to give a positive result for pattern matching. Example constraint with null-safe dereferencing Person( $streetName : address!.street ) // This is internally rewritten in the following way: Person( address != null, $streetName : address.street ) [] Use this operator to access a List value by index or a Map value by key. Example constraints with List and Map access // The following format is the same as `childList(0).getAge() == 18`: Person(childList[0].age == 18) // The following format is the same as `credentialMap.get(\"jdoe\").isValid()`: Person(credentialMap[\"jdoe\"].valid) , >= Use these operators on properties with natural ordering. For example, for Date fields, the 30 && 30 && 20 && 30 && >, >>>, , >=, instanceof Equality == != Uses equals() and !equals() semantics, not standard Java same and not same semantics Non-short-circuiting AND & Non-short-circuiting exclusive OR ^ Non-short-circuiting inclusive OR | Logical AND && Logical OR || Ternary ? : Comma-separated AND , Not standard Java semantics DRL supports the following rule condition elements (keywords) that you can use with the patterns that you define in DRL rule conditions: and Use this to group conditional components into a logical conjunction. Infix and prefix and are supported. You can group patterns explicitly with parentheses (). By default, all listed patterns are combined with and when no conjunction is specified. Figure 14. infixAnd Figure 15. prefixAnd Example patterns with and //Infix `and`: Color( colorType : type ) and Person( favoriteColor == colorType ) //Infix `and` with grouping: (Color( colorType : type ) and (Person( favoriteColor == colorType ) or Person( favoriteColor == colorType )) // Prefix `and`: (and Color( colorType : type ) Person( favoriteColor == colorType )) // Default implicit `and`: Color( colorType : type ) Person( favoriteColor == colorType ) Do not use a leading declaration binding with the and keyword (as you can with or, for example). A declaration can only reference a single fact at a time, and if you use a declaration binding with and, then when and is satisfied, it matches both facts and results in an error. Example misuse of and // Causes compile error: $person : (Person( name == \"Romeo\" ) and Person( name == \"Juliet\")) or Use this to group conditional components into a logical disjunction. Infix and prefix or are supported. You can group patterns explicitly with parentheses (). You can also use pattern binding with or, but each pattern must be bound separately. Figure 16. infixOr Figure 17. prefixOr Example patterns with or //Infix `or`: Color( colorType : type ) or Person( favoriteColor == colorType ) //Infix `or` with grouping: (Color( colorType : type ) or (Person( favoriteColor == colorType ) and Person( favoriteColor == colorType )) // Prefix `or`: (or Color( colorType : type ) Person( favoriteColor == colorType )) Example patterns with or and pattern binding pensioner : (Person( sex == \"f\", age > 60 ) or Person( sex == \"m\", age > 65 )) (or pensioner : Person( sex == \"f\", age > 60 ) pensioner : Person( sex == \"m\", age > 65 )) The Drools rule engine does not directly interpret the or element but uses logical transformations to rewrite a rule with or as a number of sub-rules. This process ultimately results in a rule that has a single or as the root node and one sub-rule for each of its condition elements. Each sub-rule is activated and executed like any normal rule, with no special behavior or interaction between the sub-rules. Therefore, consider the or condition element a shortcut for generating two or more similar rules that, in turn, can create multiple activations when two or more terms of the disjunction are true. exists Use this to specify facts and constraints that must exist. This option is triggered on only the first match, not subsequent matches. If you use this element with multiple patterns, enclose the patterns with parentheses (). Figure 18. Exists Example patterns with exists exists Person( firstName == \"John\") exists (Person( firstName == \"John\", age == 42 )) exists (Person( firstName == \"John\" ) and Person( lastName == \"Doe\" )) not Use this to specify facts and constraints that must not exist. If you use this element with multiple patterns, enclose the patterns with parentheses (). Figure 19. Not Example patterns with not not Person( firstName == \"John\") not (Person( firstName == \"John\", age == 42 )) not (Person( firstName == \"John\" ) and Person( lastName == \"Doe\" )) forall Use this to verify whether all facts that match the first pattern match all the remaining patterns. When a forall construct is satisfied, the rule evaluates to true. This element is a scope delimiter, so it can use any previously bound variable, but no variable bound inside of it is available for use outside of it. Figure 20. Forall Example rule with forall rule \"All full-time employees have red ID badges\" when forall( $emp : Employee( type == \"fulltime\" ) Employee( this == $emp, badgeColor == \"red\" ) ) then // True, all full-time employees have red ID badges. end In this example, the rule selects all Employee objects whose type is \"fulltime\". For each fact that matches this pattern, the rule evaluates the patterns that follow (badge color) and if they match, the rule evaluates to true. To state that all facts of a given type in the working memory of the Drools rule engine must match a set of constraints, you can use forall with a single pattern for simplicity. Example rule with forall and a single pattern rule \"All employees have red ID badges\" when forall( Employee( badgeColor == \"red\" ) ) then // True, all employees have red ID badges. end You can use forall constructs with multiple patterns or nest them with other condition elements, such as inside a not element construct. Example rule with forall and multiple patterns rule \"All employees have health and dental care programs\" when forall( $emp : Employee() HealthCare( employee == $emp ) DentalCare( employee == $emp ) ) then // True, all employees have health and dental care. end Example rule with forall and not rule \"Not all employees have health and dental care\" when not ( forall( $emp : Employee() HealthCare( employee == $emp ) DentalCare( employee == $emp ) ) ) then // True, not all employees have health and dental care. end The format forall( p1 p2 p3 …​) is equivalent to not( p1 and not( and p2 p3 …​ ) ). from Use this to specify a data source for a pattern. This enables the Drools rule engine to reason over data that is not in the working memory. The data source can be a sub-field on a bound variable or the result of a method call. The expression used to define the object source is any expression that follows regular MVEL syntax. Therefore, the from element enables you to easily use object property navigation, execute method calls, and access maps and collection elements. Figure 21. from Example rule with from and pattern binding rule \"Validate zipcode\" when Person( $personAddress : address ) Address( zipcode == \"23920W\" ) from $personAddress then // Zip code is okay. end Example rule with from and a graph notation rule \"Validate zipcode\" when $p : Person() $a : Address( zipcode == \"23920W\" ) from $p.address then // Zip code is okay. end Example rule with from to iterate over all objects rule \"Apply 10% discount to all items over US$ 100 in an order\" when $order : Order() $item : OrderItem( value > 100 ) from $order.items then // Apply discount to `$item`. end For large collections of objects, instead of adding an object with a large graph that the Drools rule engine must iterate over frequently, add the collection directly to the KIE session and then join the collection in the condition, as shown in the following example: when $order : Order() OrderItem( value > 100, order == $order ) Example rule with from and lock-on-active rule attribute rule \"Assign people in North Carolina (NC) to sales region 1\" ruleflow-group \"test\" lock-on-active true when $p : Person() $a : Address( state == \"NC\" ) from $p.address then modify ($p) {} // Assign the person to sales region 1. end rule \"Apply a discount to people in the city of Raleigh\" ruleflow-group \"test\" lock-on-active true when $p : Person() $a : Address( city == \"Raleigh\" ) from $p.address then modify ($p) {} // Apply discount to the person. end Using from with lock-on-active rule attribute can result in rules not being executed. You can address this issue in one of the following ways: Avoid using the from element when you can insert all facts into the working memory of the Drools rule engine or use nested object references in your constraint expressions. Place the variable used in the modify() block as the last sentence in your rule condition. Avoid using the lock-on-active rule attribute when you can explicitly manage how rules within the same ruleflow group place activations on one another. The pattern that contains a from clause cannot be followed by another pattern starting with a parenthesis. The reason for this restriction is that the DRL parser reads the from expression as \"from $l (String() or Number())\" and it cannot differentiate this expression from a function call. The simplest workaround to this is to wrap the from clause in parentheses, as shown in the following example: Example rules with from used incorrectly and correctly // Do not use `from` in this way: rule R when $l : List() String() from $l (String() or Number()) then // Actions end // Use `from` in this way instead: rule R when $l : List() (String() from $l) (String() or Number()) then // Actions end entry-point Use this to define an entry point, or event stream, corresponding to a data source for the pattern. This element is typically used with the from condition element. You can declare an entry point for events so that the Drools rule engine uses data from only that entry point to evaluate the rules. You can declare an entry point either implicitly by referencing it in DRL rules or explicitly in your Java application. Example rule with from entry-point rule \"Authorize withdrawal\" when WithdrawRequest( $ai : accountId, $am : amount ) from entry-point \"ATM Stream\" CheckingAccount( accountId == $ai, balance > $am ) then // Authorize withdrawal. end Example Java application code with EntryPoint object and inserted facts import org.kie.api.runtime.KieSession; import org.kie.api.runtime.rule.EntryPoint; // Create your KIE base and KIE session as usual: KieSession session = ... // Create a reference to the entry point: EntryPoint atmStream = session.getEntryPoint(\"ATM Stream\"); // Start inserting your facts into the entry point: atmStream.insert(aWithdrawRequest); collect Use this to define a collection of objects that the rule can use as part of the condition. The rule obtains the collection either from a specified source or from the working memory of the Drools rule engine. The result pattern of the collect element can be any concrete class that implements the java.util.Collection interface and provides a default no-arg public constructor. You can use Java collections like List, LinkedList, and HashSet, or your own class. If variables are bound before the collect element in a condition, you can use the variables to constrain both your source and result patterns. However, any binding made inside the collect element is not available for use outside of it. Figure 22. Collect Example rule with collect import java.util.List rule \"Raise priority when system has more than three pending alarms\" when $system : System() $alarms : List( size >= 3 ) from collect( Alarm( system == $system, status == 'pending' ) ) then // Raise priority because `$system` has three or more `$alarms` pending. end In this example, the rule assesses all pending alarms in the working memory of the Drools rule engine for each given system and groups them in a List. If three or more alarms are found for a given system, the rule is executed. You can also use the collect element with nested from elements, as shown in the following example: Example rule with collect and nested from import java.util.LinkedList; rule \"Send a message to all parents\" when $town : Town( name == 'Paris' ) $mothers : LinkedList() from collect( Person( children > 0 ) from $town.getPeople() ) then // Send a message to all parents. end accumulate Use this to iterate over a collection of objects, execute custom actions for each of the elements, and return one or more result objects (if the constraints evaluate to true). This element is a more flexible and powerful form of the collect condition element. You can use predefined functions in your accumulate conditions or implement custom functions as needed. You can also use the abbreviation acc for accumulate in rule conditions. Use the following format to define accumulate conditions in rules: Preferred format for accumulate accumulate( ; [;] ) Figure 23. Accumulate Although the Drools rule engine supports alternate formats for the accumulate element for backward compatibility, this format is preferred for optimal performance in rules and applications. The Drools rule engine supports the following predefined accumulate functions. These functions accept any expression as input. average min max count sum collectList collectSet In the following example rule, min, max, and average are accumulate functions that calculate the minimum, maximum, and average temperature values over all the readings for each sensor: Example rule with accumulate to calculate temperature values rule \"Raise alarm\" when $s : Sensor() accumulate( Reading( sensor == $s, $temp : temperature ); $min : min( $temp ), $max : max( $temp ), $avg : average( $temp ); $min 70 ) then // Raise the alarm. end The following example rule uses the average function with accumulate to calculate the average profit for all items in an order: Example rule with accumulate to calculate average profit rule \"Average profit\" when $order : Order() accumulate( OrderItem( order == $order, $cost : cost, $price : price ); $avgProfit : average( 1 - $cost / $price ) ) then // Average profit for `$order` is `$avgProfit`. end To use custom, domain-specific functions in accumulate conditions, create a Java class that implements the org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction interface. For example, the following Java class defines a custom implementation of an AverageData function: Example Java class with custom implementation of average function // An implementation of an accumulator capable of calculating average values public class AverageAccumulateFunction implements org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction { public void readExternal(ObjectInput in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException { } public void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out) throws IOException { } public static class AverageData implements Externalizable { public int count = 0; public double total = 0; public AverageData() {} public void readExternal(ObjectInput in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException { count = in.readInt(); total = in.readDouble(); } public void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out) throws IOException { out.writeInt(count); out.writeDouble(total); } } /* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction#createContext() */ public AverageData createContext() { return new AverageData(); } /* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction#init(java.io.Serializable) */ public void init(AverageData context) { context.count = 0; context.total = 0; } /* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction#accumulate(java.io.Serializable, java.lang.Object) */ public void accumulate(AverageData context, Object value) { context.count++; context.total += ((Number) value).doubleValue(); } /* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction#reverse(java.io.Serializable, java.lang.Object) */ public void reverse(AverageData context, Object value) { context.count--; context.total -= ((Number) value).doubleValue(); } /* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction#getResult(java.io.Serializable) */ public Object getResult(AverageData context) { return new Double( context.count == 0 ? 0 : context.total / context.count ); } /* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction#supportsReverse() */ public boolean supportsReverse() { return true; } /* (non-Javadoc) * @see org.kie.api.runtime.rule.AccumulateFunction#getResultType() */ public Class getResultType() { return Number.class; } } To use the custom function in a DRL rule, import the function using the import accumulate statement: Format to import a custom function import accumulate Example rule with the imported average function import accumulate AverageAccumulateFunction.AverageData average rule \"Average profit\" when $order : Order() accumulate( OrderItem( order == $order, $cost : cost, $price : price ); $avgProfit : average( 1 - $cost / $price ) ) then // Average profit for `$order` is `$avgProfit`. end For backward compatibility, the Drools rule engine also supports the configuration of accumulate functions through configuration files and system properties, but this is a deprecated method. To configure the average function from the previous example using the configuration file or system property, set a property as shown in the following example: drools.accumulate.function.average = AverageAccumulateFunction.AverageData Note that drools.accumulate.function is a required prefix, average is how the function is used in the DRL files, and AverageAccumulateFunction.AverageData is the fully qualified name of the class that implements the function behavior. accumulate alternate syntax for a single function with return type The accumulate syntax evolved over time with the goal of becoming more compact and expressive. Nevertheless, Drools still supports previous syntaxes for backward compatibility purposes. In case the rule is using a single accumulate function on a given accumulate, the author may add a pattern for the result object and use the \"from\" keyword to link it to the accumulate result. Example: a rule to apply a 10% discount on orders over $100 could be written in the following way: rule \"Apply 10% discount to orders over US$ 100,00\" when $order : Order() $total : Number( doubleValue > 100 ) from accumulate( OrderItem( order == $order, $value : value ), sum( $value ) ) then // apply discount to $order end In the previous example, the accumulate element is using only one function (sum), and so, the rules author opted to explicitly write a pattern for the result type of the accumulate function (Number) and write the constraints inside it. There are no problems in using this syntax over the compact syntax presented before, except that is is a bit more verbose. Also note that it is not allowed to use both the return type and the functions binding in the same accumulate statement. Compile-time checks are performed in order to ensure the pattern used with the \"from\" keyword is assignable from the result of the accumulate function used. With this syntax, the \"from\" binds to the single result returned by the accumulate function, and it does not iterate. In the previous example, \"$total\" is bound to the result returned by the accumulate sum() function. As another example however, if the result of the accumulate function is a collection, \"from\" still binds to the single result and it does not iterate: rule \"Person names\" when $x : Object() from accumulate(MyPerson( $val : name ); collectList( $val ) ) then // $x is a List end The bound \"$x : Object()\" is the List itself, returned by the collectList accumulate function used. This is an important distinction to highlight, as the \"from\" keyword can also be used separately of accumulate, to iterate over the elements of a collection: rule \"Iterate the numbers\" when $xs : List() $x : Integer() from $xs then // $x matches and binds to each Integer in the collection end While this syntax is still supported for backward compatibility purposes, for this and other reasons we encourage rule authors to make use instead of the preferred accumulate syntax (described previously), to avoid any potential pitfalls. accumulate with inline custom code Another possible syntax for the accumulate is to define inline custom code, instead of using accumulate functions. The use of accumulate with inline custom code is not a good practice for several reasons, including difficulties on maintaining and testing rules that use them, as well as the inability of reusing that code. Implementing your own accumulate functions is very simple and straightforward, they are easy to unit test and to use. This form of accumulate is supported for backward compatibility only. Only limited support for inline accumulate is provided while using the executable model. For example, you cannot use an external binding in the code while using the MVEL dialect: rule R dialect \"mvel\" when String( $l : length ) $sum : Integer() from accumulate ( Person( age > 18, $age : age ), init( int sum = 0 * $l; ), action( sum += $age; ), reverse( sum -= $age; ), result( sum ) ) The general syntax of the accumulate CE with inline custom code is: from accumulate( , init( ), action( ), reverse( ), result( ) ) The meaning of each of the elements is the following: : the source pattern is a regular pattern that the Drools rule engine will try to match against each of the source objects. : this is a semantic block of code in the selected dialect that will be executed once for each tuple, before iterating over the source objects. : this is a semantic block of code in the selected dialect that will be executed for each of the source objects. : this is an optional semantic block of code in the selected dialect that if present will be executed for each source object that no longer matches the source pattern. The objective of this code block is to undo any calculation done in the block, so that the Drools rule engine can do decremental calculation when a source object is modified or deleted, hugely improving performance of these operations. : this is a semantic expression in the selected dialect that is executed after all source objects are iterated. : this is a regular pattern that the Drools rule engine tries to match against the object returned from the . If it matches, the accumulate conditional element evaluates to true and the Drools rule engine proceeds with the evaluation of the next CE in the rule. If it does not matches, the accumulate CE evaluates to false and the Drools rule engine stops evaluating CEs for that rule. It is easier to understand if we look at an example: rule \"Apply 10% discount to orders over US$ 100,00\" when $order : Order() $total : Number( doubleValue > 100 ) from accumulate( OrderItem( order == $order, $value : value ), init( double total = 0; ), action( total += $value; ), reverse( total -= $value; ), result( total ) ) then // apply discount to $order end In the previous example, for each Order in the Working Memory, the Drools rule engine will execute the init code initializing the total variable to zero. Then it will iterate over all OrderItem objects for that order, executing the action for each one (in the example, it will sum the value of all items into the total variable). After iterating over all OrderItem objects, it will return the value corresponding to the result expression (in the previous example, the value of variable total). Finally, the Drools rule engine will try to match the result with the Number pattern, and if the double value is greater than 100, the rule will fire. The example used Java as the semantic dialect, and as such, note that the usage of the semicolon as statement delimiter is mandatory in the init, action and reverse code blocks. The result is an expression and, as such, it does not admit ';'. If the user uses any other dialect, he must comply to that dialect’s specific syntax. As mentioned before, the reverse code is optional, but it is strongly recommended that the user writes it in order to benefit from the improved performance on update and delete. The accumulate CE can be used to execute any action on source objects. The following example instantiates and populates a custom object: rule \"Accumulate using custom objects\" when $person : Person( $likes : likes ) $cheesery : Cheesery( totalAmount > 100 ) from accumulate( $cheese : Cheese( type == $likes ), init( Cheesery cheesery = new Cheesery(); ), action( cheesery.addCheese( $cheese ); ), reverse( cheesery.removeCheese( $cheese ); ), result( cheesery ) ); then // do something end eval The conditional element eval is essentially a catch-all which allows any semantic code (that returns a primitive boolean) to be executed. This code can refer to variables that were bound in the conditions of the rule and functions in the rule package. Overuse of eval reduces the declarativeness of your rules and can result in a poorly performing Drools rule engine. While eval can be used anywhere in the patterns, it is typically added as the last conditional element in the conditions of a rule. Figure 24. Eval Instances of eval cannot be indexed and thus are not as efficient as Field Constraints. However this makes them ideal for being used when functions return values that change over time, which is not allowed within Field Constraints. For those who are familiar with Drools 2.x lineage, the old Drools parameter and condition tags are equivalent to binding a variable to an appropriate type, and then using it in an eval node. p1 : Parameter() p2 : Parameter() eval( p1.getList().containsKey( p2.getItem() ) ) p1 : Parameter() p2 : Parameter() // call function isValid in the LHS eval( isValid( p1, p2 ) ) The then part of the rule (also known as the Right Hand Side (RHS) of the rule) contains the actions to be performed when the conditional part of the rule has been met. Actions consist of one or more methods that execute consequences based on the rule conditions and on available data objects in the package. For example, if a bank requires loan applicants to be over 21 years of age (with a rule condition Applicant( age ( ) Example rule action to set the values of a loan application approval $application.setApproved ( false ); $application.setExplanation( \"has been bankrupt\" ); modify Use this to specify fields to be modified for a fact and to notify the Drools rule engine of the change. This method provides a structured approach to fact updates. It combines the update operation with setter calls to change object fields. modify ( ) { , , ... } Example rule action to modify a loan application amount and approval modify( LoanApplication ) { setAmount( 100 ), setApproved ( true ) } update Use this to specify fields and the entire related fact to be updated and to notify the Drools rule engine of the change. After a fact has changed, you must call update before changing another fact that might be affected by the updated values. To avoid this added step, use the modify method instead. update ( ) // Informs the Drools rule engine that an object has changed update ( ) // Causes `KieSession` to search for a fact handle of the object Example rule action to update a loan application amount and approval LoanApplication.setAmount( 100 ); update( LoanApplication ); If you provide property-change listeners, you do not need to call this method when an object changes. For more information about property-change listeners, see [property-change-listeners-con_decision-engine]. insert Use this to insert a new fact into the working memory of the Drools rule engine and to define resulting fields and values as needed for the fact. insert( new ); Example rule action to insert a new loan applicant object insert( new Applicant() ); insertLogical Use this to insert a new fact logically into the Drools rule engine. The Drools rule engine is responsible for logical decisions on insertions and retractions of facts. After regular or stated insertions, facts must be retracted explicitly. After logical insertions, the facts that were inserted are automatically retracted when the conditions in the rules that inserted the facts are no longer true. insertLogical( new ); Example rule action to logically insert a new loan applicant object insertLogical( new Applicant() ); delete Use this to remove an object from the Drools rule engine. The keyword retract is also supported in DRL and executes the same action, but delete is typically preferred in DRL code for consistency with the keyword insert. delete( ); Example rule action to delete a loan applicant object delete( Applicant ); In addition to the standard rule action methods, the Drools rule engine supports methods in conjunction with the predefined drools variable that you can also use in rule actions. You can use the drools variable to call methods from the org.kie.api.runtime.rule.RuleContext class in your Drools distribution, which is also the class that the standard rule action methods are based on. For all drools rule action options, see the Drools RuleContext.java page in GitHub. The drools variable contains methods that provide information about the firing rule and the set of facts that activated the firing rule: drools.getRule().getName(): Returns the name of the currently firing rule. drools.getMatch(): Returns the Match that activated the currently firing rule. It contains information that is useful for logging and debugging purposes, for instance drools.getMatch().getObjects() returns the list of objects, enabling rule to fire in the proper tuple order. From the drools variable, you can also obtain a reference to the KieRuntime providing useful methods to interact with the running session, for example: drools.getKieRuntime().halt(): Terminates rule execution if a user or application previously called fireUntilHalt(). When a user or application calls fireUntilHalt() method, the Drools rule engine starts in active mode and evaluates rules until the user or application explicitly calls halt() method. Otherwise, by default, the Drools rule engine runs in passive mode and evaluates rules only when a user or an application explicitly calls fireAllRules() method. drools.getKieRuntime().getAgenda(): Returns a reference to the KIE session Agenda, and in turn provides access to rule activation groups, rule agenda groups, and ruleflow groups. Example call to access agenda group \"CleanUp\" and set the focus drools.getKieRuntime().getAgenda().getAgendaGroup( \"CleanUp\" ).setFocus(); + This example sets the focus to a specified agenda group to which the rule belongs. drools.getKieRuntime().setGlobal(), ~.getGlobal(), ~.getGlobals(): Sets or retrieves global variables. drools.getKieRuntime().getEnvironment(): Returns the runtime Environment, similar to your operating system environment. drools.getKieRuntime().getQueryResults( query): Runs a query and returns the results. In general, effective rule actions are small, declarative, and readable. However, in some cases, the limitation of having a single consequence for each rule can be challenging and lead to verbose and repetitive rule syntax, as shown in the following example rules: Example rules with verbose and repetitive syntax rule \"Give 10% discount to customers older than 60\" when $customer : Customer( age > 60 ) then modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.1 ) }; end rule \"Give free parking to customers older than 60\" when $customer : Customer( age > 60 ) $car : Car( owner == $customer ) then modify($car) { setFreeParking( true ) }; end A partial solution to the repetition is to make the second rule extend the first rule, as shown in the following modified example: Partially enhanced example rules with an extended condition rule \"Give 10% discount to customers older than 60\" when $customer : Customer( age > 60 ) then modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.1 ) }; end rule \"Give free parking to customers older than 60\" extends \"Give 10% discount to customers older than 60\" when $car : Car( owner == $customer ) then modify($car) { setFreeParking( true ) }; end As a more efficient alternative, you can consolidate the two rules into a single rule with modified conditions and labelled corresponding rule actions, as shown in the following consolidated example: Consolidated example rule with conditional and named consequences rule \"Give 10% discount and free parking to customers older than 60\" when $customer : Customer( age > 60 ) do[giveDiscount] $car : Car( owner == $customer ) then modify($car) { setFreeParking( true ) }; then[giveDiscount] modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.1 ) }; end This example rule uses two actions: the usual default action and another action named giveDiscount. The giveDiscount action is activated in the condition with the keyword do when a customer older than 60 years old is found in the KIE base, regardless of whether or not the customer owns a car. You can configure the activation of a named consequence with an additional condition, such as the if statement in the following example. The condition in the if statement is always evaluated on the pattern that immediately precedes it. Consolidated example rule with an additional condition rule \"Give free parking to customers older than 60 and 10% discount to golden ones among them\" when $customer : Customer( age > 60 ) if ( type == \"Golden\" ) do[giveDiscount] $car : Car( owner == $customer ) then modify($car) { setFreeParking( true ) }; then[giveDiscount] modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.1 ) }; end You can also evaluate different rule conditions using a nested if and else if construct, as shown in the following more complex example: Consolidated example rule with more complex conditions rule \"Give free parking and 10% discount to over 60 Golden customer and 5% to Silver ones\" when $customer : Customer( age > 60 ) if ( type == \"Golden\" ) do[giveDiscount10] else if ( type == \"Silver\" ) break[giveDiscount5] $car : Car( owner == $customer ) then modify($car) { setFreeParking( true ) }; then[giveDiscount10] modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.1 ) }; then[giveDiscount5] modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.05 ) }; end This example rule gives a 10% discount and free parking to Golden customers over 60, but only a 5% discount without free parking to Silver customers. The rule activates the consequence named giveDiscount5 with the keyword break instead of do. The keyword do schedules a consequence in the Drools rule engine agenda, enabling the remaining part of the rule conditions to continue being evaluated, while break blocks any further condition evaluation. If a named consequence does not correspond to any condition with do but is activated with break, the rule fails to compile because the conditional part of the rule is never reached. DRL supports single-line comments prefixed with a double forward slash // and multi-line comments enclosed with a forward slash and asterisk /* …​ */. You can use DRL comments to annotate rules or any related components in DRL files. DRL comments are ignored by the Drools rule engine when the DRL file is processed. Example rule with comments rule \"Underage\" // This is a single-line comment. when $application : LoanApplication() // This is an in-line comment. Applicant( age ' in rule \"simple rule\" in pattern Student A line and column value of 0:-1 means the parser reached the end of the source file () but encountered incomplete constructs, usually due to missing quotation marks \"…​\", apostrophes '…​', or parentheses (…​). 102: mismatched input Indicates that the parser expected a particular symbol that is missing at the current input position. Example rule with an incomplete rule statement 1: rule simple_rule 2: when 3: $p : Person( // Must be a complete rule statement Error message [ERR 102] Line 0:-1 mismatched input '' expecting ')' in rule \"simple rule\" in pattern Person A line and column value of 0:-1 means the parser reached the end of the source file () but encountered incomplete constructs, usually due to missing quotation marks \"…​\", apostrophes '…​', or parentheses (…​). Example rule with incorrect syntax 1: package org.drools.examples; 2: 3: rule \"Wrong syntax\" 4: when 5: not( Car( ( type == \"tesla\", price == 10000 ) || ( type == \"kia\", price == 1000 ) ) from $carList ) // Must use `&&` operators instead of commas `,` 6: then 7: System.out.println(\"OK\"); 8: end Error messages [ERR 102] Line 5:36 mismatched input ',' expecting ')' in rule \"Wrong syntax\" in pattern Car [ERR 101] Line 5:57 no viable alternative at input 'type' in rule \"Wrong syntax\" [ERR 102] Line 5:106 mismatched input ')' expecting 'then' in rule \"Wrong syntax\" In this example, the syntactic problem results in multiple error messages related to each other. The single solution of replacing the commas , with && operators resolves all errors. If you encounter multiple errors, resolve one at a time in case errors are consequences of previous errors. 103: failed predicate Indicates that a validating semantic predicate evaluated to false. These semantic predicates are typically used to identify component keywords in DRL files, such as declare, rule, exists, not, and others. Example rule with an invalid keyword 1: package nesting; 2: 3: import org.drools.compiler.Person 4: import org.drools.compiler.Address 5: 6: Some text // Must be a valid DRL keyword 7: 8: rule \"test something\" 9: when 10: $p: Person( name==\"Michael\" ) 11: then 12: $p.name = \"other\"; 13: System.out.println(p.name); 14: end Error message [ERR 103] Line 6:0 rule 'rule_key' failed predicate: {(validateIdentifierKey(DroolsSoftKeywords.RULE))}? in rule The Some text line is invalid because it does not begin with or is not a part of a DRL keyword construct, so the parser fails to validate the rest of the DRL file. This error is similar to 102: mismatched input, but usually involves DRL keywords. 104: trailing semi-colon not allowed Indicates that an eval() clause in a rule condition uses a semicolon ; but must not use one. Example rule with eval() and trailing semicolon 1: rule \"simple rule\" 2: when 3: eval( abc(); ) // Must not use semicolon `;` 4: then 5: end Error message [ERR 104] Line 3:4 trailing semi-colon not allowed in rule \"simple rule\" 105: did not match anything Indicates that the parser reached a sub-rule in the grammar that must match an alternative at least once, but the sub-rule did not match anything. The parser has entered a branch with no way out. Example rule with invalid text in an empty condition 1: rule \"empty condition\" 2: when 3: None // Must remove `None` if condition is empty 4: then 5: insert( new Person() ); 6: end Error message [ERR 105] Line 2:2 required (...)+ loop did not match anything at input 'WHEN' in rule \"empty condition\" In this example, the condition is intended to be empty but the word None is used. This error is resolved by removing None, which is not a valid DRL keyword, data type, or pattern construct. Domain Specific Languages (or DSLs) are a way of creating a rule language that is dedicated to your problem domain. A set of DSL definitions consists of transformations from DSL \"sentences\" to DRL constructs, which lets you use of all the underlying rule language and engine features. Given a DSL, you write rules in DSL rule (or DSLR) files, which will be translated into DRL files. DSL and DSLR files are plain text files, and you can use any text editor to create and modify them. But there are also DSL and DSLR editors, both in the IDE as well as in the web based BRMS, and you can use those as well, although they may not provide you with the full DSL functionality. DSLs can serve as a layer of separation between rule authoring (and rule authors) and the technical intricacies resulting from the modelling of domain object and the Drools rule engine’s native language and methods. If your rules need to be read and validated by domain experts (such as business analysts, for instance) who are not programmers, you should consider using a DSL; it hides implementation details and focuses on the rule logic proper. DSL sentences can also act as \"templates\" for conditional elements and consequence actions that are used repeatedly in your rules, possibly with minor variations. You may define DSL sentences as being mapped to these repeated phrases, with parameters providing a means for accommodating those variations. DSLs have no impact on the Drools rule engine at runtime, they are just a compile time feature, requiring a special parser and transformer. The Drools DSL mechanism allows you to customise conditional expressions and consequence actions. A global substitution mechanism (\"keyword\") is also available. Example 1. Example DSL mapping [when]Something is {colour}=Something(colour==\"{colour}\") In the preceding example, [when] indicates the scope of the expression, i.e., whether it is valid for the LHS or the RHS of a rule. The part after the bracketed keyword is the expression that you use in the rule; typically a natural language expression, but it doesn’t have to be. The part to the right of the equal sign (\"=\") is the mapping of the expression into the rule language. The form of this string depends on its destination, RHS or LHS. If it is for the LHS, then it ought to be a term according to the regular LHS syntax; if it is for the RHS then it might be a Java statement. Whenever the DSL parser matches a line from the rule file written in the DSL with an expression in the DSL definition, it performs three steps of string manipulation. First, it extracts the string values appearing where the expression contains variable names in braces (here: {colour}). Then, the values obtained from these captures are then interpolated wherever that name, again enclosed in braces, occurs on the right hand side of the mapping. Finally, the interpolated string replaces whatever was matched by the entire expression in the line of the DSL rule file. Note that the expressions (i.e., the strings on the left hand side of the equal sign) are used as regular expressions in a pattern matching operation against a line of the DSL rule file, matching all or part of a line. This means you can use (for instance) a '?' to indicate that the preceding character is optional. One good reason to use this is to overcome variations in natural language phrases of your DSL. But, given that these expressions are regular expression patterns, this also means that all \"magic\" characters of Java’s pattern syntax have to be escaped with a preceding backslash ('\\'). It is important to note that the compiler transforms DSL rule files line by line. In the previous example, all the text after \"Something is \" to the end of the line is captured as the replacement value for \"{colour}\", and this is used for interpolating the target string. This may not be exactly what you want. For instance, when you intend to merge different DSL expressions to generate a composite DRL pattern, you need to transform a DSLR line in several independent operations. The best way to achieve this is to ensure that the captures are surrounded by characteristic text - words or even single characters. As a result, the matching operation done by the parser plucks out a substring from somewhere within the line. In the example below, quotes are used as distinctive characters. Note that the characters that surround the capture are not included during interpolation, just the contents between them. As a rule of thumb, use quotes for textual data that a rule editor may want to enter. You can also enclose the capture with words to ensure that the text is correctly matched. Both is illustrated by the following example. Note that a single line such as Something is \"green\" and another solid thing is now correctly expanded. Example 2. Example with quotes [when]something is \"{colour}\"=Something(colour==\"{colour}\") [when]another {state} thing=OtherThing(state==\"{state})\" It is a good idea to avoid punctuation (other than quotes or apostrophes) in your DSL expressions as much as possible. The main reason is that punctuation is easy to forget for rule authors using your DSL. Another reason is that parentheses, the period and the question mark are magic characters, requiring escaping in the DSL definition. In a DSL mapping, the braces \"{\" and \"}\" should only be used to enclose a variable definition or reference, resulting in a capture. If they should occur literally, either in the expression or within the replacement text on the right hand side, they must be escaped with a preceding backslash (\"\\\"): [then]do something= if (foo) \\{ doSomething(); \\} If braces \"{\" and \"}\" should appear in the replacement string of a DSL definition, escape them with a backslash ('\\'). Example 3. Examples of DSL mapping entries # This is a comment to be ignored. [when]There is a person with name of \"{name}\"=Person(name==\"{name}\") [when]Person is at least {age} years old and lives in \"{location}\"= Person(age >= {age}, location==\"{location}\") [then]Log \"{message}\"=System.out.println(\"{message}\"); [when]And = and Given the above DSL examples, the following examples show the expansion of various DSLR snippets: Example 4. Examples of DSL expansions There is a person with name of \"Kitty\" ==> Person(name=\"Kitty\") Person is at least 42 years old and lives in \"Atlanta\" ==> Person(age >= 42, location=\"Atlanta\") Log \"boo\" ==> System.out.println(\"boo\"); There is a person with name of \"Bob\" And Person is at least 30 years old and lives in \"Utah\" ==> Person(name=\"Bob\") and Person(age >= 30, location=\"Utah\") Don’t forget that if you are capturing plain text from a DSL rule line and want to use it as a string literal in the expansion, you must provide the quotes on the right hand side of the mapping. You can chain DSL expressions together on one line, as long as it is clear to the parser where one ends and the next one begins and where the text representing a parameter ends. (Otherwise you risk getting all the text until the end of the line as a parameter value.) The DSL expressions are tried, one after the other, according to their order in the DSL definition file. After any match, all remaining DSL expressions are investigated, too. The resulting DRL text may consist of more than one line. Line ends are in the replacement text are written as \\n. A common requirement when writing rule conditions is to be able to add an arbitrary combination of constraints to a pattern. Given that a fact type may have many fields, having to provide an individual DSL statement for each combination would be plain folly. The DSL facility allows you to add constraints to a pattern by a simple convention: if your DSL expression starts with a hyphen (minus character, \"-\") it is assumed to be a field constraint and, consequently, is is added to the last pattern line preceding it. For an example, lets take look at class Cheese, with the following fields: type, price, age and country. We can express some LHS condition in normal DRL like the following Cheese(age = [when][]is greater than=> [when][]is equal to=== [when][]equals=== [when][]There is a Cheese with=Cheese() [when][]- {field:\\w*} {operator} {value:\\d*}={field} {operator} {value} Given these DSL definitions, you can write rules with conditions such as: There is a Cheese with - age is less than 42 - rating is greater than 50 - type equals 'stilton' In this specific case, a phrase such as \"is less than\" is replaced by 50, type=='stilton') The order of the entries in the DSL is important if separate DSL expressions are intended to match the same line, one after the other. A good way to get started is to write representative samples of the rules your application requires, and to test them as you develop. This will provide you with a stable framework of conditional elements and their constraints. Rules, both in DRL and in DSLR, refer to entities according to the data model representing the application data that should be subject to the reasoning process defined in rules. Notice that writing rules is generally easier if most of the data model’s types are facts. Given an initial set of rules, it should be possible to identify recurring or similar code snippets and to mark variable parts as parameters. This provides reliable leads as to what might be a handy DSL entry. Also, make sure you have a full grasp of the jargon the domain experts are using, and base your DSL phrases on this vocabulary. You may postpone implementation decisions concerning conditions and actions during this first design phase by leaving certain conditional elements and actions in their DRL form by prefixing a line with a greater sign (\">\"). (This is also handy for inserting debugging statements.) During the next development phase, you should find that the DSL configuration stabilizes pretty quickly. New rules can be written by reusing the existing DSL definitions, or by adding a parameter to an existing condition or consequence entry. Try to keep the number of DSL entries small. Using parameters lets you apply the same DSL sentence for similar rule patterns or constraints. But do not exaggerate: authors using the DSL should still be able to identify DSL phrases by some fixed text. A DSL file is a text file in a line-oriented format. Its entries are used for transforming a DSLR file into a file according to DRL syntax. A line starting with \"\" or \"//\" (with or without preceding white space) is treated as a comment. A comment line starting with \"/\" is scanned for words requesting a debug option, see below. Any line starting with an opening bracket (\"[\") is assumed to be the first line of a DSL entry definition. Any other line is appended to the preceding DSL entry definition, with the line end replaced by a space. A DSL entry consists of the following four parts: A scope definition, written as one of the keywords \"when\" or \"condition\", \"then\" or \"consequence\", \"*\" and \"keyword\", enclosed in brackets (\"[\" and \"]\"). This indicates whether the DSL entry is valid for the condition or the consequence of a rule, or both. A scope indication of \"keyword\" means that the entry has global significance, i.e., it is recognized anywhere in a DSLR file. A type definition, written as a Java class name, enclosed in brackets. This part is optional unless the next part begins with an opening bracket. An empty pair of brackets is valid, too. A DSL expression consists of a (Java) regular expression, with any number of embedded variable definitions, terminated by an equal sign (\"=\"). A variable definition is enclosed in braces (\"{\" and \"}\"). It consists of a variable name and two optional attachments, separated by colons (\":\"). If there is one attachment, it is a regular expression for matching text that is to be assigned to the variable; if there are two attachments, the first one is a hint for the GUI editor and the second one the regular expression. Note that all characters that are \"magic\" in regular expressions must be escaped with a preceding backslash (\"\\\") if they should occur literally within the expression. The remaining part of the line after the delimiting equal sign is the replacement text for any DSLR text matching the regular expression. It may contain variable references, i.e., a variable name enclosed in braces. Optionally, the variable name may be followed by an exclamation mark (\"!\") and a transformation function, see below. Note that braces (\"{\" and \"}\") must be escaped with a preceding backslash (\"\\\") if they should occur literally within the replacement string. Debugging of DSL expansion can be turned on, selectively, by using a comment line starting with \"#/\" which may contain one or more words from the table presented below. The resulting output is written to standard output. Table 2. Debug options for DSL expansion Word Description result Prints the resulting DRL text, with line numbers. steps Prints each expansion step of condition and consequence lines. keyword Dumps the internal representation of all DSL entries with scope \"keyword\". when Dumps the internal representation of all DSL entries with scope \"when\" or \"*\". then Dumps the internal representation of all DSL entries with scope \"then\" or \"*\". usage Displays a usage statistic of all DSL entries. Below are some sample DSL definitions, with comments describing the language features they illustrate. # Comment: DSL examples #/ debug: display result and usage # keyword definition: replaces \"regula\" by \"rule\" [keyword][]regula=rule # conditional element: \"T\" or \"t\", \"a\" or \"an\", convert matched word [when][][Tt]here is an? {entity:\\w+}= ${entity!lc}: {entity!ucfirst} () # consequence statement: convert matched word, literal braces [then][]update {entity:\\w+}=modify( ${entity!lc} )\\{ \\} The transformation of a DSLR file proceeds as follows: The text is read into memory. Each of the \"keyword\" entries is applied to the entire text. First, the regular expression from the keyword definition is modified by replacing white space sequences with a pattern matching any number of white space characters, and by replacing variable definitions with a capture made from the regular expression provided with the definition, or with the default (\".*?\"). Then, the DSLR text is searched exhaustively for occurrences of strings matching the modified regular expression. Substrings of a matching string corresponding to variable captures are extracted and replace variable references in the corresponding replacement text, and this text replaces the matching string in the DSLR text. Sections of the DSLR text between \"when\" and \"then\", and \"then\" and \"end\", respectively, are located and processed in a uniform manner, line by line, as described below. For a line, each DSL entry pertaining to the line’s section is taken in turn, in the order it appears in the DSL file. Its regular expression part is modified: white space is replaced by a pattern matching any number of white space characters; variable definitions with a regular expression are replaced by a capture with this regular expression, its default being \".*?\". If the resulting regular expression matches all or part of the line, the matched part is replaced by the suitably modified replacement text. Modification of the replacement text is done by replacing variable references with the text corresponding to the regular expression capture. This text may be modified according to the string transformation function given in the variable reference; see below for details. If there is a variable reference naming a variable that is not defined in the same entry, the expander substitutes a value bound to a variable of that name, provided it was defined in one of the preceding lines of the current rule. If a DSLR line in a condition is written with a leading hyphen, the expanded result is inserted into the last line, which should contain a pattern CE, i.e., a type name followed by a pair of parentheses. if this pair is empty, the expanded line (which should contain a valid constraint) is simply inserted, otherwise a comma (\",\") is inserted beforehand. If a DSLR line in a consequence is written with a leading hyphen, the expanded result is inserted into the last line, which should contain a \"modify\" statement, ending in a pair of braces (\"{\" and \"}\"). If this pair is empty, the expanded line (which should contain a valid method call) is simply inserted, otherwise a comma (\",\") is inserted beforehand. It is currently not possible to use a line with a leading hyphen to insert text into other conditional element forms (e.g., \"accumulate\") or it may only work for the first insertion (e.g., \"eval\"). All string transformation functions are described in the following table. Table 3. String transformation functions Name Description uc Converts all letters to upper case. lc Converts all letters to lower case. ucfirst Converts the first letter to upper case, and all other letters to lower case. num Extracts all digits and \"-\" from the string. If the last two digits in the original string are preceded by \".\" or \",\", a decimal period is inserted in the corresponding position. a?b/c Compares the string with string a, and if they are equal, replaces it with b, otherwise with c. But c can be another triplet a, b, c, so that the entire structure is, in fact, a translation table. The following DSL examples show how to use string transformation functions. # definitions for conditions [when][]There is an? {entity}=${entity!lc}: {entity!ucfirst}() [when][]- with an? {attr} greater than {amount}={attr} 0/negative?%lt;0/zero?==0/ERROR} A file containing a DSL definition has to be put under the resources folder or any of its subfolders like any other drools artifact. It must have the extension .dsl, or alternatively be marked with type ResourceType.DSL. when programmatically added to a KieFileSystem. For a file using DSL definition, the extension .dslr should be used, while it can be added to a KieFileSystem with type ResourceType.DSLR. For parsing and expanding a DSLR file the DSL configuration is read and supplied to the parser. Thus, the parser can \"recognize\" the DSL expressions and transform them into native rule language expressions.","title":"Rule Language Reference (Traditional)","component":"drools","version":"","name":"index","url":"/drools/language-reference-traditional/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Traditional DRL Syntax","hash":"","id":1},{"text":"Packages in DRL","hash":"drl-packages-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":2},{"text":"Import statements in DRL","hash":"drl-imports-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":3},{"text":"Functions in DRL","hash":"drl-functions-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":4},{"text":"Queries in DRL","hash":"drl-queries-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":5},{"text":"Type declarations and metadata in DRL","hash":"drl-declarations-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":6},{"text":"Type declarations without metadata in DRL","hash":"drl-declarations-without-metadata-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":7},{"text":"Enumerative type declarations in DRL","hash":"drl-declarations-enumerative-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":8},{"text":"Extended type declarations in DRL","hash":"drl-declarations-extended-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":9},{"text":"Type declarations with metadata in DRL","hash":"drl-declarations-with-metadata-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":10},{"text":"Access to DRL declared types in application code","hash":"drl-declarations-access-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":11},{"text":"Global variables in DRL","hash":"drl-globals-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":12},{"text":"Timer and calendar rule attributes in DRL","hash":"drl-timers-calendars-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":13},{"text":"Rule conditions in DRL (WHEN)","hash":"drl-rules-WHEN-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":14},{"text":"Patterns and constraints","hash":"_patterns_and_constraints","id":15},{"text":"Bound variables in patterns and constraints","hash":"_bound_variables_in_patterns_and_constraints","id":16},{"text":"Nested constraints and inline casts","hash":"_nested_constraints_and_inline_casts","id":17},{"text":"Date literal in constraints","hash":"_date_literal_in_constraints","id":18},{"text":"Auto-boxing and primitive types","hash":"_auto_boxing_and_primitive_types","id":19},{"text":"Supported operators in DRL pattern constraints","hash":"drl-operators-ref_drl-rules-traditional","id":20},{"text":"Operator precedence in DRL pattern constraints","hash":"drl-operator-precedence-ref_drl-rules-traditional","id":21},{"text":"Supported rule condition elements in DRL (keywords)","hash":"drl-rules-WHEN-elements-ref_drl-rules-traditional","id":22},{"text":"Rule actions in DRL (THEN)","hash":"drl-rules-THEN-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":23},{"text":"Supported rule action methods in DRL","hash":"drl-rules-THEN-methods-ref_drl-rules-traditional","id":24},{"text":"Other rule action methods from drools variable","hash":"drl-rules-THEN-methods-variables-ref_drl-rules-traditional","id":25},{"text":"Advanced rule actions with conditional and named consequences","hash":"drl-rules-THEN-advanced-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":26},{"text":"Comments in DRL files","hash":"drl-rules-comments-con_drl-rules-traditional","id":27},{"text":"Error messages for DRL troubleshooting","hash":"drl-rules-errors-ref_drl-rules-traditional","id":28},{"text":"Domain Specific Languages","hash":"_domain_specific_languages","id":29},{"text":"When to Use a DSL","hash":"_when_to_use_a_dsl","id":30},{"text":"DSL Basics","hash":"_dsl_basics","id":31},{"text":"Adding Constraints to Facts","hash":"_adding_constraints_to_facts","id":32},{"text":"Developing a DSL","hash":"_developing_a_dsl","id":33},{"text":"DSL and DSLR Reference","hash":"_dsl_and_dslr_reference","id":34}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"Firstly, migration from Drools 8 to Drools 10 is very simple. You just need to change the version in pom.xml. All APIs and DRL syntax are compatible. This guide rather focuses on how to migrate from Drools 7 projects to Drools 10 projects. Drools 10 supports Drools 7 APIs and DRL syntax, so basically you don’t need to change your Java codes and rule assets. However, there are some cautions in pom.xml. Typical Drools 6 or early 7 projects have pom dependencies like this. Traditional pom.xml org.drools drools-core ${version.org.drools} org.drools drools-compiler ${version.org.drools} But since Drools 7.45.0, drools-engine and drools-engine-classic have been introduced as aggregator dependencies. The dependencies drools-engine-classic, drools-mvel are deprecated starting with Drools 8. Hence, use drools-engine. org.drools drools-engine ${version.org.drools} Some module refactoring were made during the version upgrades, so you may find some difficulty in collecting dependencies. This aggregator dependency would help. As introduced in First Rule Project, using Rule Units is a recommended style for implementing rules in Drools 10. It will require some modifications to your codebase, but if you are going to develop cloud-native applications, Rule Units are strongly recommended, because Kogito also works with Rule Units. Rule Unit pom.xml org.drools drools-ruleunits-engine ${version.org.drools} drools-ruleunits-engine is required for Rule Unit APIs. Regarding related Java API usage, in Drools 7, you create a KieSession from rule assets. Then insert facts and fire rules. Traditional Java code KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieContainer kcontainer = ks.getKieClasspathContainer(); KieBase kbase = kcontainer.getKieBase(); KieSession ksession = kbase.newKieSession(); try { ksession.insert(new Measurement(\"color\", \"red\")); ksession.insert(new Measurement(\"color\", \"green\")); ksession.fireAllRules(); } finally { ksession.dispose(); } Using Rule Unit APIs, the resulting Java snippet would be like this: Rule Unit Java code MeasurementUnit measurementUnit = new MeasurementUnit(); try (RuleUnitInstance instance = RuleUnitProvider.get().createRuleUnitInstance(measurementUnit)) { measurementUnit.getMeasurements().add(new Measurement(\"color\", \"red\")); measurementUnit.getMeasurements().add(new Measurement(\"color\", \"green\")); instance.fire(); } // instance.close() is called automatically In Rule Unit, instantiate RuleUnitInstance instead of KieSession. Add facts to DataSource property instead of insert. Generic KIE API calls (e.g. KieServices, KieContainer, KieBase …​ ) are no longer needed. Instead, one more class Unit has to be defined. Rule Unit Class public class MeasurementUnit implements RuleUnitData { private final DataStore measurements; private final Set controlSet = new HashSet<>(); public MeasurementUnit() { this(DataSource.createStore()); } public MeasurementUnit(DataStore measurements) { this.measurements = measurements; } public DataStore getMeasurements() { return measurements; } public Set getControlSet() { return controlSet; } } This Unit class associates rules (DRL) and inserted facts (DataSource), so it helps you to manage the relationship. DRL syntax style also changes. Traditional DRL global java.util.Set controlSet; rule \"will execute per each Measurement having ID color\" when Measurement( id == \"color\", $colorVal : val ) then controlSet.add($colorVal); end Rule Unit DRL unit MeasurementUnit; rule \"will execute per each Measurement having ID color\" when /measurements[ id == \"color\", $colorVal : val ] then controlSet.add($colorVal); end Firstly, declare unit. Don’t need to declare global, because controlSet is a field of MeasurementUnit. Traditional global usage would become the Unit’s field. In addition, the main difference is OOPath notation in LHS. It is described in detail at Rule conditions in DRL. You should change from the class name (Measurement) to the DataSource property name in the Unit class (measurements). In addition, you need to take care of the insert in RHS. The insert method inserts a fact into a \"DEFAULT\" entry-point, but in Rule Unit use cases, you must specify a DataSource where you want to insert the fact. Hence, you must call DataStore.add or DataStream.append instead of insert. Traditional DRL rule \"Insert another Measurement\" when Measurement( id == \"color\", $colorVal : val ) then insert(new Measurement(\"monochrome\", \"false\")); end Rule Unit DRL unit MeasurementUnit; rule \"Insert another Measurement\" when /measurements[ id == \"color\", $colorVal : val ] then measurements.add(new Measurement(\"monochrome\", \"false\")); end Note that you don’t need to re-write update, modify and delete, because they work for a fact in its DataSource expectedly. These changes are not negligible, but hopefully, as this migration guide demonstrated, they are not so difficult to implement either. The drools-engine-classic and drools-mvel execute rules with non executable model. drools-engine executes rules with executable model. For more details about the executable model, see Executable rule models. As mentioned, drools-engine-classic and drools-mvel are deprecated, it is recommended to migrate from a non-executable model to an executable model by changing dependencies. In general, from an external perspective, rule evaluation and rule consequence execution results can be expected to be the same using either the non-executable model or the executable model. You may however encounter a few edge cases during compile time or runtime. If you find any issues, please report them to the Drools community. We have already identified some small known differences, reported below. When you specify dialect \"mvel\" in a rule, the non-executable model is tolerant of invalid type cast, because of type coercion behavior in MVEL. For example, global MyUtils myUtils; rule Rule1 dialect \"mvel\" when $p : Person() then myUtils.doWork((String) $p.age ))); end This rule can be built with non-executable model even if $p.age is int which is not acceptable in Java syntax. With executable model, the rule fails with a build error. Cannot cast from int to String In this case, the rule can be easily fixed by using valid Java syntax. For example, ... then myUtils.doWork(java.util.Objects.toString( $p.age )); end non-executable model is tolerant of generics type. For example, rule Rule1 no-loop true when $fact : Fact( str == \"ADD\", $val : \"100\") then modify($fact) { bdList.add($val); } end non-executable model allows to add a String object to bdList even if Fact.bdList is List which is not acceptable in Java syntax. With executable model, the rule fails with a build error. The method add(BigDecimal) in the type List is not applicable for the arguments (String) In this case, the rule can be easily fixed by using valid Java syntax. For example, ... then modify($fact) { bdList.add(new BigDecimal($val)); } end For example, Java allows coercion from int to long. However, Java doesn’t allow coercion from int to Long. If you have the rule to call the setWrapperLong method which accepts Long. rule Rule1 dialect \"mvel\" when $f : Fact() then $f.setWrapperLong(10); end non-executable model coerces 10 to Long, so it doesn’t throw an Exception. However, the executable model throws a build error. The method setWrapperLong(Long) in the type Fact is not applicable for the arguments (int) In this case, the rule can be easily fixed by using valid Java syntax. For example, ... then $f.setWrapperLong(10L); end Assuming you have classes below: parent class public abstract class Vehicle { // ... public abstract TEngine getEngine(); public TEngine getMotor() { return getEngine(); } sub class public class DieselCar extends Vehicle { private final DieselEngine engine; public DieselCar(String maker, String model, int kw, boolean adBlueRequired) { super(maker, model); this.engine = new DieselEngine(kw, adBlueRequired); } @Override public DieselEngine getEngine() { return engine; } } public class DieselEngine extends Engine { private final boolean adBlueRequired; rule rule Rule1 when $v : DieselCar(motor.adBlueRequired == true) then // do something end non-executable model can dynamically resolve that motor is DieselEngine so the rule works. However, the executable model resolves motor to TEngine, so a build error is thrown. Unknown field adBlueRequired on TEngine In this case, the rule can be fixed by specifying the subtype with the # operator. For example, when $v : DieselCar(motor#DieselEngine.adBlueRequired == true) KIE Server is retired and no longer a component since Drools 8. If your system is working on KIE Server with Drools 7, consider migration to Kogito. While KIE Server hosts multiple kjar containers, One Kogito instance hosts one domain service. Hence, you would create Kogito project per kjar container, which would be microservice style. You can find the detailed migration steps in the next sections, Overview of migration from Drools v7 to Kogito microservices. Business Central is retired and no longer a component since Drools 8. For asset management, the usual version control system is recommended, for example, git. For editors, VS Code Kogito extension is recommended. BPMN integration and Rule flow can be achieved by Kogito. Starting with Drools v8, Drools spreadsheet decision tables file extension must end in either .drl.xls, .drl.xlsx, or .drl.csv as mentioned in the Release Notes. You can migrate the decision service artifacts that you developed in Drools v7 to Kogito microservices. Kogito currently supports migration for the following types of decision services: Decision Model and Notation (DMN) models: You migrate DMN-based decision services by moving the DMN resources from KJAR artifacts to the respective Kogito archetype. Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) models: You migrate PMML-based prediction and prediction services by moving the PMML resources from KJAR artifacts to the respective Kogito archetype. Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules: You migrate the DRL-based decision services by enclosing them in a Quarkus REST endpoint. This approach of migration enables you to use major Quarkus features, such as hot reload and native compilation. The Quarkus features and the programming model of Kogito enable the automatic generation of the Quarkus REST endpoints for implementation in your applications and services. You can migrate DMN-based decision services from Drools v7 to Kogito microservices by moving the DMN resources from KJAR artifacts to the respective Kogito project. In the Kogito microservices, some of the KIE v7 features are no longer required. The following table describes the major changes and features that affect migration from the KIE Server API and KJAR to Kogito deployments: Table 1. DMN migration considerations Feature In KIE Server API In Kogito artifact DMN models stored in src/main/resources of KJAR. copy as is to src/main/resources. Object models (POJOs) required for KIE Server generic marshalling managed using Data Model object editor in Business Central. object model editing is no longer required. DMNRuntimeListener configured using a system property or kmodule.xml file. must be configured using CDI, by annotating the DMNRuntimeEventListener with CDI’s @ApplicationScope annotation. Other configuration options configured using system property or kmodule.xml file. except DMNRuntimeEventListener, only default values are considered and no override of configuration is supported. KIE Server Client API used in conjunction with object models to interact with a KJAR that is deployed on the KIE Server. for object models, this feature is no longer required. You can select your own choice of REST library. REST API when a KJAR is deployed on KIE Server, the applications interacting with specific DMN model endpoint, use the same API on Kogito deployment. advanced support for specific DMN model generation. Test scenarios run with a JUnit activator. analogous JUnit activator is available on Kogito. The features that are not mentioned in the previous table are either not supported or not required in a cloud-native Kogito deployment. When migrating a DMN project to a Kogito project, first you can migrate external applications that are interacting with decision services on the KIE Server. You can use the REST endpoints that are specific to DMN models. After using the REST endpoints, you can migrate the external applications from the KIE Server to a Kogito deployment. For additional information about specific REST endpoints to DMN models, you can reference the REST endpoints for specific DMN models blog post. The migration strategy includes the following steps: Migrate existing external applications from the generic KIE Server API to a specific DMN REST endpoint using the KIE Server. Migrate a KJAR that is deployed on the KIE Server to a Kogito microservice. Deploy the Kogito microservice using OpenShift. Reconnect the external application and migrate the REST API consumption from the specific DMN REST endpoint to the Kogito deployment. To migrate a DMN project to a Kogito deployment, first you can migrate external applications that use specific DMN REST endpoints to interact with decision services on the KIE Server. Procedure If you are using the REST endpoints in your external application, retrieve the Swagger or OAS specification file of the KJAR using GET /server/containers/{containerId}/dmn/openapi.json (|.yaml) endpoint. For additional information about REST endpoints for specific DMN models, you can reference REST endpoints for specific DMN models blog post. In your external application, select the Java or JDK library to interact with the decision services. You can interact with the decision services using the REST endpoint for the specific KJAR. The KIE Server Client Java API is not supported in the migration to a Kogito deployment. After migrating your external application, you need to migrate a KJAR that is specific to a DMN model to a Kogito microservice. Procedure Create a Maven project for your Kogito microservice. For additional information about the procedure about creating a Maven project, you can reference Modeling and development of decision services: DMN with Kogito blog post. The Maven project creates Kogito artifacts. Copy the DMN models from the src/main/resources folder of the KJAR to the src/main/resources folder of the Kogito artifact. Copy the test scenarios from the src/test/resources folder of the KJAR to the src/test/resources folder of the Kogito artifact. You need to import the Kogito dependency of test scenarios in the pom.xml file of your project and create a JUnit activator using the KIE Server REST API. Run the following command and ensure that the test scenario is running for the specified non-regression tests. mvn clean install After running the Kogito application, you can retrieve the Swagger or OAS specification file. The Swagger or OAS specifications provide the same information as the REST endpoint along with the following implementation details: Base URL of the server where the API is available References Schemas names You can use the provided implementation details when your external application is re-routed to the new URL. After migrating a DMN model KJAR to a Kogito microservice, you can deploy the microservice using OpenShift. The following is an example of migrating a DMN model KJAR to a Kogito microservice: Figure 1. Example decision service implemented using DMN model Figure 2. Example DMN model using specific ItemDefinition structure You need to define the object model (POJO) as a DTO in an existing KJAR that is developed in Business Central. Example of an object model defined as DTO in a KJAR package com.myspace.demo20210321; /** * This class was automatically generated by the data modeler tool. */ public class Reservation implements java.io.Serializable { static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; @com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonFormat(shape = com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonFormat.Shape.STRING, pattern = \"yyyy-MM-dd\") @com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.annotation.JsonSerialize(using = com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jsr310.ser.LocalDateSerializer.class) private java.time.LocalDate checkin; @com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonFormat(shape = com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonFormat.Shape.STRING, pattern = \"yyyy-MM-dd\") @com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.annotation.JsonSerialize(using = com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jsr310.ser.LocalDateSerializer.class) private java.time.LocalDate checkout; private java.util.List guests; public Reservation() { } public java.time.LocalDate getCheckin() { return this.checkin; } public void setCheckin(java.time.LocalDate checkin) { this.checkin = checkin; } public java.time.LocalDate getCheckout() { return this.checkout; } public void setCheckout(java.time.LocalDate checkout) { this.checkout = checkout; } public java.util.List getGuests() { return this.guests; } public void setGuests(java.util.List guests) { this.guests = guests; } public Reservation(java.time.LocalDate checkin, java.time.LocalDate checkout, java.util.List guests) { this.checkin = checkin; this.checkout = checkout; this.guests = guests; } } In the previous example, the defined DTO is used in conjunction with the KIE Server client Java API. Alternatively, you can specify the DTO in the payload, when a non-Java external application is interacting with the KJAR that is deployed on the KIE Server. Example of using KIE Server client Java API DMNServicesClient dmnClient = kieServicesClient.getServicesClient(DMNServicesClient.class); DMNContext dmnContext = dmnClient.newContext(); dmnContext.set(\"reservation\", new com.myspace.demo20210321.Reservation(LocalDate.of(2021, 3, 1), LocalDate.of(2021, 3, 8), Arrays.asList(\"John\", \"Alice\"))); run(dmnClient, dmnContext); Figure 3. Example of manually specifying DTO in the payload In the previous example, the FQCN of the object model in the REST API is used for the generic KIE Server marshalling. After deploying the Kogito microservice, you need to bind your external application to the Kogito microservice deployment. Binding your external application includes re-routing the external application and binding the application to a new base URL of the server that is associated with the Kogito application. For more information, see the following example: Figure 4. Example /discount REST endpoint of KJAR on KIE Server Figure 5. Example /discount REST endpoint on local Kogito Figure 6. Example /discount REST endpoint bound to new base URL of Kogito You can build and deploy a sample project in Kogito to expose a stateless rules evaluation of the Drools rule engine in a Quarkus REST endpoint, and migrate the REST endpoint to Kogito. The stateless rule evaluation is a single execution of a rule set in Drools and can be identified as a function invocation. In the invoked function, the output values are determined using the input values. Also, the invoked function uses the Drools rule engine to perform the jobs. Therefore, in such cases, a function is exposed using a REST endpoint and converted into a microservice. After converting into a microservice, a function is deployed into a Function as a Service environment to eliminate the cost of JVM startup time. You can find additional information in the Bringing Drools rules into the cloud with Kogito: a step by step path blog post. The following table describes the major changes and features that affect migration from the KIE Server API and KJAR to Kogito deployments: Table 2. DRL migration considerations Feature In KIE Server API In Kogito with legacy API support In Kogito artifact DRL files stored in src/main/resources folder of KJAR. copy as is to src/main/resources folder. rewrite using the rule units and OOPath. KieContainer configured using a system property or kmodule.xml file. replaced by KieRuntimeBuilder. not required. KieBase or KieSession configured using a system property or kmodule.xml file. configured using a system property or kmodule.xml file. replaced by rule units. In Drools, you can migrate a rule evaluation to a Kogito deployment in the following two ways: Using legacy API in Kogito In Kogito, the kogito-legacy-api module makes the legacy API of Drools available; therefore, the DRL files remain unchanged. This approach of migrating rule evaluation requires minimal changes and enables you to use major Quarkus features, such as hot reload and native image creation. Migrating to Kogito rule units Migrating to Kogito rule units include the programming model of Kogito, which is based on the concept of rule units. A rule unit in Kogito includes both a set of rules and the facts, against which the rules are matched. Rule units in Kogito also come with data sources. A rule unit data source is a source of the data processed by a given rule unit and represents the entry point, which is used to evaluate the rule unit. Rule units use two types of data sources: DataStream: This is an append-only data source and the facts added into the DataStream cannot be updated or removed. DataStore: This data source is for modifiable data. You can update or remove an object using the FactHandle that is returned when the object is added into the DataStore. Overall, a rule unit contains two parts: The definition of the fact to be evaluated and the set of rules evaluating the facts. In the following sections, a loan application project is used as an example to migrate a DRL project to Kogito deployments. The domain model of the loan application project is made of two classes, the LoanApplication class and the Applicant class: Example LoanApplication class public class LoanApplication { private String id; private Applicant applicant; private int amount; private int deposit; private boolean approved = false; public LoanApplication(String id, Applicant applicant, int amount, int deposit) { this.id = id; this.applicant = applicant; this.amount = amount; this.deposit = deposit; } } Example Applicant class public class Applicant { private String name; private int age; public Applicant(String name, int age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; } } The rule set is created using business decisions to approve or reject an application, along with the last rule of collecting all the approved applications in a list. Example rule set in loan application global Integer maxAmount; global java.util.List approvedApplications; rule LargeDepositApprove when $l: LoanApplication( applicant.age >= 20, deposit >= 1000, amount = 20, deposit >= 1000, amount > maxAmount ) then modify($l) { setApproved(false) }; // loan is rejected end // ... more loans approval/rejections business rules ... rule CollectApprovedApplication when $l: LoanApplication( approved ) then approvedApplications.add($l); // collect all approved loan applications end You can expose the rule evaluation that is developed in Business Central with a REST endpoint using Quarkus. Procedure Create a new module based on the module that contains the rules and Quarkus libraries, providing the REST support: Example dependencies for creating a new module io.quarkus quarkus-resteasy io.quarkus quarkus-resteasy-jackson org.example drools-project 1.0-SNAPSHOT Create a REST endpoint. The following is an example setup for creating a REST endpoint: Example FindApprovedLoansEndpoint endpoint setup @Path(\"/find-approved\") public class FindApprovedLoansEndpoint { private static final KieContainer kContainer = KieServices.Factory.get().newKieClasspathContainer(); @POST() @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) public List executeQuery(LoanAppDto loanAppDto) { KieSession session = kContainer.newKieSession(); List approvedApplications = new ArrayList<>(); session.setGlobal(\"approvedApplications\", approvedApplications); session.setGlobal(\"maxAmount\", loanAppDto.getMaxAmount()); loanAppDto.getLoanApplications().forEach(session::insert); session.fireAllRules(); session.dispose(); return approvedApplications; } } In the previous example, a KieContainer containing the rules is created and added into a static field. The rules in the KieContainer are obtained from the other module in the class path. Using this approach, you can reuse the same KieContainer for subsequent invocations related to the FindApprovedLoansEndpoint endpoint without recompiling the rules. The two modules are consolidated in the next process of migrating rule units to a Kogito microservice using legacy API. When the FindApprovedLoansEndpoint endpoint is invoked, a new KieSession is created from the KieContainer. The KieSession is populated with the objects from LoanAppDto resulting from the unmarshalling of a JSON request. Example LoanAppDto class public class LoanAppDto { private int maxAmount; private List loanApplications; public int getMaxAmount() { return maxAmount; } public void setMaxAmount(int maxAmount) { this.maxAmount = maxAmount; } public List getLoanApplications() { return loanApplications; } public void setLoanApplications(List loanApplications) { this.loanApplications = loanApplications; } } When the fireAllRules() method is called, KieSession is fired and the business logic is evaluated against the input data. After business logic evaluation, the last rule collects all the approved applications in a list and the same list is returned as an output. Start the Quarkus application. Invoke the FindApprovedLoansEndpoint endpoint with a JSON request that contains the loan applications to be checked. The value of the maxAmount is used in the rules as shown in the following example: Example curl request curl -X POST -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"maxAmount\":5000, \"loanApplications\":[ {\"id\":\"ABC10001\",\"amount\":2000,\"deposit\":1000,\"applicant\":{\"age\":45,\"name\":\"John\"}}, {\"id\":\"ABC10002\",\"amount\":5000,\"deposit\":100,\"applicant\":{\"age\":25,\"name\":\"Paul\"}}, {\"id\":\"ABC10015\",\"amount\":1000,\"deposit\":100,\"applicant\":{\"age\":12,\"name\":\"George\"}} ]}' http://localhost:8080/find-approved Example JSON response [ { \"id\": \"ABC10001\", \"applicant\": { \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 45 }, \"amount\": 2000, \"deposit\": 1000, \"approved\": true } ] Using this approach, you cannot use the hot reload feature and cannot create a native image of the project. In the next steps, the missing Quarkus features are provided by the Kogito extension that enables Quarkus aware of the DRL files and implement the hot reload feature in a similar way. After exposing a rule evaluation with a REST endpoint, you can migrate the rule evaluation to a Kogito microservice using legacy API. Procedure Add the following dependencies to the project pom.xml file to enable the use of Quarkus and legacy API: Example dependencies for using Quarkus and legacy API org.kie.kogito kogito-quarkus-rules org.kie.kogito kogito-legacy-api Rewrite the REST endpoint implementation: Example REST endpoint implementation @Path(\"/find-approved\") public class FindApprovedLoansEndpoint { @Inject KieRuntimeBuilder kieRuntimeBuilder; @POST() @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) public List executeQuery(LoanAppDto loanAppDto) { KieSession session = kieRuntimeBuilder.newKieSession(); List approvedApplications = new ArrayList<>(); session.setGlobal(\"approvedApplications\", approvedApplications); session.setGlobal(\"maxAmount\", loanAppDto.getMaxAmount()); loanAppDto.getLoanApplications().forEach(session::insert); session.fireAllRules(); session.dispose(); return approvedApplications; } } In the rewritten REST endpoint implementation, instead of creating the KieSession from the KieContainer, the KieSession is created automatically using an integrated KieRuntimeBuilder. The KieRuntimeBuilder is an interface provided by the kogito-legacy-api module that replaces the KieContainer. Using KieRuntimeBuilder, you can create KieBases and KieSessions in a similar way you create in KieContainer. Kogito automatically generates an implementation of KieRuntimeBuilder interface at compile time and integrates the KieRuntimeBuilder into a class, which implements the FindApprovedLoansEndpoint REST endpoint. Start your Quarkus application in development mode. You can also use the hot reload to make the changes to the rules files that are applied to the running application. Also, you can create a native image of your rule based application. After migrating rule units to a Kogito microservice, you can implement the rule units and automatic generation of the REST endpoint. In Kogito, a rule unit contains a set of rules and the facts, against which the rules are matched. Rule units in Kogito also come with data sources. A rule unit data source is a source of the data processed by a given rule unit and represents the entry point, which is used to evaluate the rule unit. Rule units use two types of data sources: DataStream: This is an append-only data source. In DataStream, subscribers receive new and past messages, stream can be hot or cold in the reactive streams. Also, the facts added into the DataStream cannot be updated or removed. DataStore: This data source is for modifiable data. You can update or remove an object using the FactHandle that is returned when the object is added into the DataStore. Overall, a rule unit contains two parts: the definition of the fact to be evaluated and the set of rules evaluating the facts. Procedure Implement a fact definition using POJO: Example implementation of a fact definition using POJO package org.kie.kogito.queries; import org.kie.kogito.rules.DataSource; import org.kie.kogito.rules.DataStore; import org.kie.kogito.rules.RuleUnitData; public class LoanUnit implements RuleUnitData { private int maxAmount; private DataStore loanApplications; public LoanUnit() { this(DataSource.createStore(), 0); } public LoanUnit(DataStore loanApplications, int maxAmount) { this.loanApplications = loanApplications; this.maxAmount = maxAmount; } public DataStore getLoanApplications() { return loanApplications; } public void setLoanApplications(DataStore loanApplications) { this.loanApplications = loanApplications; } public int getMaxAmount() { return maxAmount; } public void setMaxAmount(int maxAmount) { this.maxAmount = maxAmount; } } In the previous example, instead of using LoanAppDto the LoanUnit class is bound directly. LoanAppDto is used to marshall or unmarshall JSON requests. Also, the previous example implements the org.kie.kogito.rules.RuleUnitData interface and uses a DataStore to contain the loan applications to be approved. The org.kie.kogito.rules.RuleUnitData is a marker interface to notify the Drools rule engine that LoanUnit class is part of a rule unit definition. In addition, the DataStore is responsible to allow the rule engine to react on the changes by firing new rules and triggering other rules. Additionally, the consequences of the rules modify the approved property in the previous example. On the contrary, the maxAmount value is considered as a configuration parameter for the rule unit, which is not modified. The maxAmount is processed automatically during the rules evaluation and automatically set from the value passed in the JSON requests. Implement a DRL file: Example implementation of a DRL file package org.kie.kogito.queries; unit LoanUnit; // no need to using globals, all variables and facts are stored in the rule unit rule LargeDepositApprove when $l: /loanApplications[ applicant.age >= 20, deposit >= 1000, amount = 20, deposit >= 1000, amount > maxAmount ] then modify($l) { setApproved(false) }; end // ... more loans approval/rejections business rules ... // approved loan applications are now retrieved through a query query FindApproved $l: /loanApplications[ approved ] end The DRL file that you create must declare the same package as fact definition implementation and a unit with the same name of the Java class. The Java class implements the RuleUnitData interface to state that the interface belongs to the same rule unit. Also, the DRL file in the previous example is rewritten using the OOPath expressions. In the DRL file, the data source acts as an entry point and the OOPath expression contains the data source name as root. However, the constraints are added in square brackets as follows: $l: /loanApplications[ applicant.age >= 20, deposit >= 1000, amount ⇐ maxAmount ] Alternatively, you can use the standard DRL syntax, in which you can specify the data source name as an entry point. However, you need to specify the type of the matched object again as shown in the following example, even if the Drools rule engine can infer the type from the data source: $l: LoanApplication( applicant.age >= 20, deposit >= 1000, amount ⇐ maxAmount ) from entry-point loanApplications In the previous example, the last rule that collects all the approved loan applications is replaced by a query that retrieves the list. A rule unit defines the facts to be passed in input to evaluate the rules, and the query defines the expected output from the rule evaluation. Using this approach, Kogito can automatically generate a class that executes the query and returns the output as shown in the following example: Example LoanUnitQueryFindApproved class public class LoanUnitQueryFindApproved implements org.kie.kogito.rules.RuleUnitQuery> { private final RuleUnitInstance instance; public LoanUnitQueryFindApproved(RuleUnitInstance instance) { this.instance = instance; } @Override public List execute() { return instance.executeQuery(\"FindApproved\").stream().map(this::toResult).collect(toList()); } private org.kie.kogito.queries.LoanApplication toResult(Map tuple) { return (org.kie.kogito.queries.LoanApplication) tuple.get(\"$l\"); } } The following is an example of a REST endpoint that takes a rule unit as input and passing the input to a query executor to return the output: Example LoanUnitQueryFindApprovedEndpoint endpoint @Path(\"/find-approved\") public class LoanUnitQueryFindApprovedEndpoint { @jakarta.inject.Inject RuleUnit ruleUnit; public LoanUnitQueryFindApprovedEndpoint() { } public LoanUnitQueryFindApprovedEndpoint(RuleUnit ruleUnit) { this.ruleUnit = ruleUnit; } @POST() @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) public List executeQuery(org.kie.kogito.queries.LoanUnit unit) { RuleUnitInstance instance = ruleUnit.createInstance(unit); return instance.executeQuery(LoanUnitQueryFindApproved.class); } } You can also add multiple queries and for each query, a different REST endpoint is generated. For example, the FindApproved REST endpoint is generated for find-approved.","title":"Migration Guide","component":"drools","version":"","name":"index","url":"/drools/migration-guide/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Migrate to Drools 10","hash":"traditional-to-ruleunit_migration-guide","id":1},{"text":"Rule Unit","hash":"_rule_unit","id":2},{"text":"Migration from non-executable model to executable model","hash":"nonexec-model-to-exec-model_migration-guide","id":3},{"text":"Invalid cast","hash":"_invalid_cast","id":4},{"text":"Generics support","hash":"_generics_support","id":5},{"text":"Invalid coercion","hash":"_invalid_coercion","id":6},{"text":"Generics return type resolution","hash":"_generics_return_type_resolution","id":7},{"text":"KIE Server","hash":"kie-server_migration-guide","id":8},{"text":"Business Central","hash":"business-central_migration-guide","id":9},{"text":"BPMN integration / Rule flow","hash":"bpmn-integration_migration-guide","id":10},{"text":"Spreadsheet decision tables file extensions","hash":"spreadsheet_file_extensions_migration-guide","id":11},{"text":"Overview of migration from Drools v7 to Kogito microservices","hash":"con-migration-to-kogito-overview_migration-guide","id":12},{"text":"Migration of a DMN service from Drools v7 to a Kogito microservice","hash":"con-migrate-dmn-to-kogito-overview_migration-guide","id":13},{"text":"Major changes and migration considerations","hash":"ref-migrate-dmn-to-kogito-considerations_migration-guide","id":14},{"text":"Migration strategy","hash":"con-migration-dmn-strategy_migration-guide","id":15},{"text":"Migrating external applications to REST endpoints specific to DMN models","hash":"proc-kogito-migrate-external-application-REST_migration-guide","id":16},{"text":"Migrating a DMN model KJAR to a Kogito microservice","hash":"proc-kogito-migrate-dmn-model-kjar_migration-guide","id":17},{"text":"Example of migrating a DMN model KJAR to a Kogito microservice","hash":"ref-migrate-kjar-dmn-example_migration-guide","id":18},{"text":"Example of binding an external application to a Kogito deployment","hash":"ref-example-bind-external-app-kogito_migration-guide","id":19},{"text":"Migration of a DRL service from Drools v7 to a Kogito microservice","hash":"con-migrate-drl-to-kogito-loan-overview_migration-guide","id":20},{"text":"Major changes and migration considerations","hash":"ref-migrate-drl-to-kogito-considerations_migration-guide","id":21},{"text":"Migration strategy","hash":"con-migration-drl-strategy_migration-guide","id":22},{"text":"Example loan application project","hash":"ref-kogito-migrate-example-loan-application-project_migration-guide","id":23},{"text":"Exposing rule evaluation with a REST endpoint using Quarkus","hash":"proc-kogito-migrate-drl-expose-ruleunits_migration-guide","id":24},{"text":"Migrating a rule evaluation to a Kogito microservice using legacy API","hash":"proc-kogito-migrate-drl-legacy-api_migration-guide","id":25},{"text":"Implementing rule units and automatic REST endpoint generation","hash":"proc-kogito-migrate-drl-implement-ruleunits_migration-guide","id":26}]},"10":{"id":10,"text":"As a business analyst or business rules developer, you can integrate Machine Learning (ML) with Drools by using PMML files with Decision Model and Notation (DMN) models. You can also integrate other Drools knowledge assets such as DRL with external Deep Learning (ML/DL) libraries. This section of the documentation is dedicated to highlight one pragmatic example, using DMN and PMML. When you think about Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning and big data might come to mind. But machine learning is only part of the picture. Artificial intelligence includes the following technologies: Robotics: The integration of technology, science, and engineering that produces machines that can perform physical tasks that are performed by humans Machine learning: The ability of a collection of algorithms to learn or improve when exposed to data without being explicitly programmed to do so Natural language processing: A subset of machine learning that processes human speech Mathematical optimization: The use of conditions and constraints to find the optimal solution to a problem Digital decisioning: The use of defined criteria, conditions, and a series of machine and human tasks to make decisions While science fiction is filled with what is referred to as artificial general intelligence (AGI), machines that perform better than people and cannot be distinguished from them and learn and evolve without human intervention or control, AGI is decades away. Meanwhile, we have pragmatic AI which is much less frightening and much more useful to us today. Pragmatic AI is a collection of AI technologies that, when combined, provide solutions to problems such as predicting customer behavior, providing automated customer service, and helping customers make purchasing decisions. Leading industry analysts report that previously organizations have struggled with AI technologies because they invested in the potential of AI rather than the reality of what AI can deliver today. AI projects were not productive and as a result investment in AI slowed and budgets for AI projects were reduced. This disillusionment with AI is often referred to as an AI winter. AI has experienced several cycles of AI winters followed by AI springs and we are now decidedly in an AI spring. Organizations are seeing the practical reality of what AI can deliver. Being pragmatic means being practical and realistic. A pragmatic approach to AI considers AI technologies that are available today, combines them where useful, and adds human intervention when needed to create solutions to real-world problems. Pragmatic AI solution example One application of pragmatic AI is in customer support. A customer files a support ticket that reports a problem, for example, a login error. A machine learning algorithm is applied to the ticket to match the ticket content with existing solutions, based on keywords or natural language processing (NLP). The keywords might appear in many solutions, some relevant and some not as relevant. You can use digital decisioning to determine which solutions to present to the customer. However, sometimes none of the solutions proposed by the algorithm are appropriate to propose to the customer. This can be because all solutions have a low confidence score or multiple solutions have a high confidence score. In cases where an appropriate solution cannot be found, the digital decisioning can involve the human support team. To find the best support person based on availability and expertise, mathematical optimization selects the best assignee for the support ticket by considering employee rostering constraints. As this example shows, you can combine machine learning to extract information from data analysis and digital decisioning to model human knowledge and experience. You can then apply mathematical optimization to schedule human assistance. This is a pattern that you can apply to other situations, for example, a credit card dispute and credit card fraud detection. These technologies use four industry standards: Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) CMMN is used to model work methods that include various activities that might be performed in an unpredictable order depending on circumstances. CMMN models are event centered. CMMN overcomes limitations of what can be modeled with BPMN2 by supporting less structured work tasks and tasks driven by humans. By combining BPMN and CMMN you can create much more powerful models. Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN2) The BPMN2 specification is an Object Management Group (OMG) specification that defines standards for graphically representing a business process, defines execution semantics for the elements, and provides process definitions in XML format. BPMN2 can model computer and human tasks. Decision Model and Notation (DMN) Decision Model and Notation (DMN) is a standard established by the OMG for describing and modeling operational decisions. DMN defines an XML schema that enables DMN models to be shared between DMN-compliant platforms and across organizations so that business analysts and business rules developers can collaborate in designing and implementing DMN decision services. The DMN standard is similar to and can be used together with the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard for designing and modeling business processes. Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) PMML is the language used to represent predictive models, mathematical models that use statistical techniques to uncover, or learn, patterns in large volumes of data. Predictive models use the patterns that they learn to predict the existence of patterns in new data. With PMML, you can share predictive models between applications. This data is exported as a PMML file that can be consumed by a DMN model. As a machine learning framework continues to train the model, the updated data can be saved to the existing PMML file. This means that you can use predictive models created by any application that can save the model as a PMML file. Therefore, DMN and PMML integrate well. Putting it all together This illustration shows how predictive decision automation works. Business data enters the system, for example, data from a loan application. A decision model that is integrated with a predictive model decides whether or not to approve the loan or whether additional tasks are required. A business action results, for example, a rejection letter or loan offer is sent to the customer. The next section demonstrates how predictive decision automation works with Drools. The financial industry uses pragmatic AI for decisioning in several areas. One area is credit card charge disputes. When a customer identifies an incorrect or unrecognized charge on a credit card bill, the customer can dispute the charge. Human intervention in credit card fraud detection is required in some cases but the majority of reported credit card fraud can be completely or partially resolved with pragmatic AI. This use case example is about the fictitious Fortress Bank, the bank’s customer Joe, and the business process management (BPM) developer Michelle. First we will look at how the bank originally used AI through Drools digital decisioning and then we will see how Michelle enhanced the decision model with a Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) model created from machine learning. Machine learning models such as Tensorflow™ and R™ produce predictive models. You can save these predictive models in an open standard such as PMML so that you can use the model with Drools or other products that support the PMML standard. Drools and OpenShift Fortress Bank uses Drools on OpenShift to develop and run the Fortress Bank decision services. OpenShift is a cloud platform for developing and running containerized applications, on top of Kubernetes. It is designed to enable applications and the data centers that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to thousands of machines that serve millions of clients. You can use Drools as a platform for creating cloud-native decision services, business automation applications and microservices. Drools, in this context, enables enterprise business and IT users to document, simulate, manage, automate, and monitor business processes and decisions. Credit card dispute digital decisioning with Drools Joe is a Fortress Bank customer. Each month, he logs in to the Fortress Bank website to review all of the charges on his bill before he pays it. This month, Joe sees a transaction that he recognizes but the amount is incorrect. The vendor has charged him $44.50 instead of $4.50. Joe selects the row that contains the incorrect item and clicks Dispute. This action initiates a series of questions about the dispute: Why are you disputing these transactions? Has your card been with you the entire time? Is there anything else you would like to tell us about this dispute? After Joe answers the questions, the website provides Joe with an incident number, FR-00000004. Fortress Bank must now decide whether to reimburse the disputed amount without human investigation or whether to investigate the claim manually. Manual investigation requires more resources so automatic processing of the disputed amount costs the bank less in terms of human resources. However, if the bank automatically accepts all disputed amounts the cost will ultimately be greater to the bank because of money paid for fraudulent claims. Someone or something must make the decision whether or not to investigate. Credit Card Dispute project To help with this decisioning, Fortress Bank created the CreditCardDisputeCase project that contains the fraudDispute business process that models the dispute process. Process variables When Joe reported the dispute, an instance of the fraudDispute process was created with case ID FR-00000004. The Process Variables tab contains several variables and values specific to Joe’s account, including CaseID, caseFile_cardholderRiskRating (the credit card holder risk rating), and caseFile_disputeRiskRating (the risk rating of this dispute): The table also has the casefile_automated variable with the value true. This indicates that the dispute met the criteria to be automatically processed. Process diagram The Diagram tab contains the BPMN diagram that shows the decision paths that the bank uses when deciding whether to process a dispute automatically or manually: The Decision Task task contains the rules that determine whether the dispute will be automatically charged back to Joe’s account (Milestone 1) or whether more investigation is required (Milestone 2) based on the values of the caseFile_cardholderRiskRating and the caseFile_disputeRiskRating variables. If Joe’s dispute matches the criteria for automatic approval, Milestone 1 is followed and the disputed amount is charged back to his account. This sub-process is very lean and efficient. If Joe’s dispute requires manual evaluation, the sub-process in Milestone 2 is started, which will require some human actor involvement and will take more resources to process. In this case, the Decision Task task decided to process Joe’s dispute automatically so it followed Milestone 1: Automatic Chargeback. DMN model The following simplified DMN model shows the decision process that is part of the fraudDispute Decision Task task: The input variables are Age (cardholder age), Incident Count (the number of previous disputes for this cardholder), Cardholder Status (standard, silver, gold, platinum), and Fraud Amount. Drools uses input variables in decision tables to support digital decisioning. The decision tables are created by human business analysts. The analyst creates a draft business requirement analysis document or spreadsheet that stakeholders review and approve. The project designer then uses the KIE DMN Editor to transfer the data in the analysis document to the DMN model. The Fortress Bank Credit Card Dispute process has two decision tables, the Cardholder Risk Rating table and the Dispute Risk Rating table. The Cardholder Risk Rating table contains three input variables: Incident Count, Cardholder Status, and Age. The Dispute Risk Rating table contains the Cardholder Status input variable. The table calculates the risk of the dispute based on the cardholder status and the amount of the dispute. Cardholder Risk Rating Joe is a Silver cardholder over the age of 25. He has had more than two previous disputes, so he has a risk rating of 2. If Joe had no previous disputes, he would have a risk rating of 0. Dispute Risk Rating Because Joe is a Silver cardholder and the disputed amount is $40, Joe has a rating of 1 on the Dispute Risk Rating table. If the disputed amount was $140, Joe would have a risk rating of 2. The following formula, which is implemented as part of the Process Automatically final decision in the DMN model, uses the scores from the two decision tables to determine whether to automatically charge back the disputed amount (Milestone 1) or whether more investigation is needed (Milestone 2).

The basic function of the Drools rule engine is to match incoming data, or facts, to the conditions of rules and determine whether and how to execute the rules. The Drools rule engine operates using the following basic components: Rules: Business rules or DMN decisions that you define. All rules must contain at a minimum the conditions that trigger the rule and the actions that the rule dictates. Facts: Data that enters or changes in the Drools rule engine that the Drools rule engine matches to rule conditions to execute applicable rules. Production memory: Location where rules are stored in the Drools rule engine. Working memory: Location where facts are stored in the Drools rule engine. Agenda: Location where activated rules are registered and sorted (if applicable) in preparation for execution. When a business user or an automated system adds or updates rule-related information in Drools, that information is inserted into the working memory of the Drools rule engine in the form of one or more facts. The Drools rule engine matches those facts to the conditions of the rules that are stored in the production memory to determine eligible rule executions. (This process of matching facts to rules is often referred to as pattern matching.) When rule conditions are met, the Drools rule engine activates and registers rules in the agenda, where the Drools rule engine then sorts prioritized or conflicting rules in preparation for execution. The following diagram illustrates these basic components of the Drools rule engine: Figure 1. Overview of basic Drools rule engine components For more details and examples of rule and fact behavior in the Drools rule engine, see Inference and truth maintenance in the Drools rule engine. These core concepts can help you to better understand other more advanced components, processes, and sub-processes of the Drools rule engine, and as a result, to design more effective business assets in Drools. In Drools, a KIE session stores and executes runtime data. The KIE session is created from a KIE base or directly from a KIE container if you have defined the KIE session in the KIE module descriptor file (kmodule.xml) for your project. Example KIE session configuration in a kmodule.xml file ... ... ... ... A KIE base is a repository that you define in the KIE module descriptor file (kmodule.xml) for your project and contains all in Drools, but does not contain any runtime data. Example KIE base configuration in a kmodule.xml file ... ... ... A KIE session can be stateless or stateful. In a stateless KIE session, data from a previous invocation of the KIE session (the previous session state) is discarded between session invocations. In a stateful KIE session, that data is retained. The type of KIE session you use depends on your project requirements and how you want data from different asset invocations to be persisted. A stateless KIE session is a session that does not use inference to make iterative changes to facts over time. In a stateless KIE session, data from a previous invocation of the KIE session (the previous session state) is discarded between session invocations, whereas in a stateful KIE session, that data is retained. A stateless KIE session behaves similarly to a function in that the results that it produces are determined by the contents of the KIE base and by the data that is passed into the KIE session for execution at a specific point in time. The KIE session has no memory of any data that was passed into the KIE session previously. Stateless KIE sessions are commonly used for the following use cases: Validation, such as validating that a person is eligible for a mortgage Calculation, such as computing a mortgage premium Routing and filtering, such as sorting incoming emails into folders or sending incoming emails to a destination For example, consider the following driver’s license data model and sample DRL rule: Data model for driver’s license application public class Applicant { private String name; private int age; private boolean valid; // Getter and setter methods } Sample DRL rule for driver’s license application package com.company.license rule \"Is of valid age\" when $a : Applicant(age \"01-jan-2009\") then $a.setValid(false); end Expanded Java source with iterable execution in a stateless KIE session StatelessKieSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKnowledgeSession(); Applicant applicant = new Applicant(\"Mr John Smith\", 16); Application application = new Application(); assertTrue(application.isValid()); ksession.execute(Arrays.asList(new Object[] { application, applicant })); (1) assertFalse(application.isValid()); ksession.execute (CommandFactory.newInsertIterable(new Object[] { application, applicant })); (2) List cmds = new ArrayList(); (3) cmds.add(CommandFactory.newInsert(new Person(\"Mr John Smith\"), \"mrSmith\")); cmds.add(CommandFactory.newInsert(new Person(\"Mr John Doe\"), \"mrDoe\")); BatchExecutionResults results = ksession.execute(CommandFactory.newBatchExecution(cmds)); assertEquals(new Person(\"Mr John Smith\"), results.getValue(\"mrSmith\")); 1 Method for executing rules against an iterable collection of objects produced by the Arrays.asList() method. Every collection element is inserted before any matched rules are executed. The execute(Object object) and execute(Iterable objects) methods are wrappers around the execute(Command command) method that comes from the BatchExecutor interface. 2 Execution of the iterable collection of objects using the CommandFactory interface. 3 BatchExecutor and CommandFactory configurations for working with many different commands or result output identifiers. The CommandFactory interface supports other commands that you can use in the BatchExecutor, such as StartProcess, Query, and SetGlobal. The StatelessKieSession object supports global variables (globals) that you can configure to be resolved as session-scoped globals, delegate globals, or execution-scoped globals. Session-scoped globals: For session-scoped globals, you can use the method getGlobals() to return a Globals instance that provides access to the KIE session globals. These globals are used for all execution calls. Use caution with mutable globals because execution calls can be executing simultaneously in different threads. Session-scoped global import org.kie.api.runtime.StatelessKieSession; StatelessKieSession ksession = kbase.newStatelessKieSession(); // Set a global `myGlobal` that can be used in the rules. ksession.setGlobal(\"myGlobal\", \"I am a global\"); // Execute while resolving the `myGlobal` identifier. ksession.execute(collection); Delegate globals: For delegate globals, you can assign a value to a global (with setGlobal(String, Object)) so that the value is stored in an internal collection that maps identifiers to values. Identifiers in this internal collection have priority over any supplied delegate. If an identifier cannot be found in this internal collection, the delegate global (if any) is used. Execution-scoped globals: For execution-scoped globals, you can use the Command object to set a global that is passed to the CommandExecutor interface for execution-specific global resolution. The CommandExecutor interface also enables you to export data using out identifiers for globals, inserted facts, and query results: Out identifiers for globals, inserted facts, and query results import org.kie.api.runtime.ExecutionResults; // Set up a list of commands. List cmds = new ArrayList(); cmds.add(CommandFactory.newSetGlobal(\"list1\", new ArrayList(), true)); cmds.add(CommandFactory.newInsert(new Person(\"jon\", 102), \"person\")); cmds.add(CommandFactory.newQuery(\"Get People\" \"getPeople\")); // Execute the list. ExecutionResults results = ksession.execute(CommandFactory.newBatchExecution(cmds)); // Retrieve the `ArrayList`. results.getValue(\"list1\"); // Retrieve the inserted `Person` fact. results.getValue(\"person\"); // Retrieve the query as a `QueryResults` instance. results.getValue(\"Get People\"); A stateful KIE session is a session that uses inference to make iterative changes to facts over time. In a stateful KIE session, data from a previous invocation of the KIE session (the previous session state) is retained between session invocations, whereas in a stateless KIE session, that data is discarded. Ensure that you call the dispose() method after running a stateful KIE session so that no memory leaks occur between session invocations. Stateful KIE sessions are commonly used for the following use cases: Monitoring, such as monitoring a stock market and automating the buying process Diagnostics, such as running fault-finding processes or medical diagnostic processes Logistics, such as parcel tracking and delivery provisioning Ensuring compliance, such as verifying the legality of market trades For example, consider the following fire alarm data model and sample DRL rules: Data model for sprinklers and fire alarm public class Room { private String name; // Getter and setter methods } public class Sprinkler { private Room room; private boolean on; // Getter and setter methods } public class Fire { private Room room; // Getter and setter methods } public class Alarm { } Sample DRL rule set for activating sprinklers and alarm rule \"When there is a fire turn on the sprinkler\" when Fire($room : room) $sprinkler : Sprinkler(room == $room, on == false) then modify($sprinkler) { setOn(true) }; System.out.println(\"Turn on the sprinkler for room \"+$room.getName()); end rule \"Raise the alarm when we have one or more fires\" when exists Fire() then insert( new Alarm() ); System.out.println( \"Raise the alarm\" ); end rule \"Cancel the alarm when all the fires have gone\" when not Fire() $alarm : Alarm() then delete( $alarm ); System.out.println( \"Cancel the alarm\" ); end rule \"Status output when things are ok\" when not Alarm() not Sprinkler( on == true ) then System.out.println( \"Everything is ok\" ); end For the When there is a fire turn on the sprinkler rule, when a fire occurs, the instances of the Fire class are created for that room and inserted into the KIE session. The rule adds a constraint for the specific room matched in the Fire instance so that only the sprinkler for that room is checked. When this rule is executed, the sprinkler activates. The other sample rules determine when the alarm is activated or deactivated accordingly. Whereas a stateless KIE session relies on standard Java syntax to modify a field, a stateful KIE session relies on the modify statement in rules to notify the Drools rule engine of changes. The Drools rule engine then reasons over the changes and assesses impact on subsequent rule executions. This process is part of the Drools rule engine ability to use inference and truth maintenance and is essential in stateful KIE sessions. In this example, the sample rules and all other files in the ~/resources folder of the Drools project are built with the following code: Create the KIE container KieServices kieServices = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieContainer kContainer = kieServices.getKieClasspathContainer(); This code compiles all the rule files found on the class path and adds the result of this compilation, a KieModule object, in the KieContainer. Finally, the KieSession object is instantiated from the KieContainer and is executed against specified data: Instantiate the stateful KIE session and enter data KieSession ksession = kContainer.newKieSession(); String[] names = new String[]{\"kitchen\", \"bedroom\", \"office\", \"livingroom\"}; Map name2room = new HashMap(); for( String name: names ){ Room room = new Room( name ); name2room.put( name, room ); ksession.insert( room ); Sprinkler sprinkler = new Sprinkler( room ); ksession.insert( sprinkler ); } ksession.fireAllRules(); Console output > Everything is ok With the data added, the Drools rule engine completes all pattern matching but no rules have been executed, so the configured verification message appears. As new data triggers rule conditions, the Drools rule engine executes rules to activate the alarm and later to cancel the alarm that has been activated: Enter new data to trigger rules Fire kitchenFire = new Fire( name2room.get( \"kitchen\" ) ); Fire officeFire = new Fire( name2room.get( \"office\" ) ); FactHandle kitchenFireHandle = ksession.insert( kitchenFire ); FactHandle officeFireHandle = ksession.insert( officeFire ); ksession.fireAllRules(); Console output > Raise the alarm > Turn on the sprinkler for room kitchen > Turn on the sprinkler for room office ksession.delete( kitchenFireHandle ); ksession.delete( officeFireHandle ); ksession.fireAllRules(); Console output > Cancel the alarm > Turn off the sprinkler for room office > Turn off the sprinkler for room kitchen > Everything is ok In this case, a reference is kept for the returned FactHandle object. A fact handle is an internal engine reference to the inserted instance and enables instances to be retracted or modified later. As this example illustrates, the data and results from previous stateful KIE sessions (the activated alarm) affect the invocation of subsequent sessions (alarm cancellation). In use cases with large amounts of KIE runtime data and high system activity, KIE sessions might be created and disposed very frequently. A high turnover of KIE sessions is not always time consuming, but when the turnover is repeated millions of times, the process can become a bottleneck and require substantial clean-up effort. For these high-volume cases, you can use KIE session pools instead of many individual KIE sessions. To use a KIE session pool, you obtain a KIE session pool from a KIE container, define the initial number of KIE sessions in the pool, and create the KIE sessions from that pool as usual: Example KIE session pool // Obtain a KIE session pool from the KIE container KieContainerSessionsPool pool = kContainer.newKieSessionsPool(10); // Create KIE sessions from the KIE session pool KieSession kSession = pool.newKieSession(); In this example, the KIE session pool starts with 10 KIE sessions in it, but you can specify the number of KIE sessions that you need. This integer value is the number of KIE sessions that are only initially created in the pool. If required by the running application, the number of KIE sessions in the pool can dynamically grow beyond that value. After you define a KIE session pool, the next time you use the KIE session as usual and call dispose() on it, the KIE session is reset and pushed back into the pool instead of being destroyed. KIE session pools typically apply to stateful KIE sessions, but KIE session pools can also affect stateless KIE sessions that you reuse with multiple execute() calls. When you create a stateless KIE session directly from a KIE container, the KIE session continues to internally create a new KIE session for each execute() invocation. Conversely, when you create a stateless KIE session from a KIE session pool, the KIE session internally uses only the specific KIE sessions provided by the pool. When you finish using a KIE session pool, you can call the shutdown() method on it to avoid memory leaks. Alternatively, you can call dispose() on the KIE container to shut down all the pools created from the KIE container. The basic function of the Drools rule engine is to match data to business rules and determine whether and how to execute rules. To ensure that relevant data is applied to the appropriate rules, the Drools rule engine makes inferences based on existing knowledge and performs the actions based on the inferred information. For example, the following DRL rule determines the age requirements for adults, such as in a bus pass policy: Rule to define age requirement rule \"Infer Adult\" when $p : Person(age >= 18) then insert(new IsAdult($p)); end Based on this rule, the Drools rule engine infers whether a person is an adult or a child and performs the specified action (the then consequence). Every person who is 18 years old or older has an instance of IsAdult inserted for them in the working memory. This inferred relation of age and bus pass can then be invoked in any rule, such as in the following rule segment: $p : Person() IsAdult(person == $p) In many cases, new data in a rule system is the result of other rule executions, and this new data can affect the execution of other rules. If the Drools rule engine asserts data as a result of executing a rule, the Drools rule engine uses truth maintenance to justify the assertion and enforce truthfulness when applying inferred information to other rules. Truth maintenance also helps to identify inconsistencies and to handle contradictions. For example, if two rules are executed and result in a contradictory action, the Drools rule engine chooses the action based on assumptions from previously calculated conclusions. The Drools rule engine inserts facts using either stated or logical insertions: Stated insertions: Defined with insert(). After stated insertions, facts are generally retracted explicitly. (The term insertion, when used generically, refers to stated insertion.) Logical insertions: Defined with insertLogical(). After logical insertions, the facts that were inserted are automatically retracted when the conditions in the rules that inserted the facts are no longer true. The facts are retracted when no condition supports the logical insertion. A fact that is logically inserted is considered to be justified by the Drools rule engine. For example, the following sample DRL rules use stated fact insertion to determine the age requirements for issuing a child bus pass or an adult bus pass: Rules to issue bus pass, stated insertion rule \"Issue Child Bus Pass\" when $p : Person(age = 18) then insert(new AdultBusPass($p)); end These rules are not easily maintained in the Drools rule engine as bus riders increase in age and move from child to adult bus pass. As an alternative, these rules can be separated into rules for bus rider age and rules for bus pass type using logical fact insertion. The logical insertion of the fact makes the fact dependent on the truth of the when clause. The following DRL rules use logical insertion to determine the age requirements for children and adults: Children and adult age requirements, logical insertion rule \"Infer Child\" when $p : Person(age = 18) then insertLogical(new IsAdult($p)); end For logical insertions, your fact objects must override the equals and hashCode methods from the java.lang.Object object according to the Java standard. Two objects are equal if their equals methods return true for each other and if their hashCode methods return the same values. For more information, see the Java API documentation for your Java version. When the condition in the rule is false, the fact is automatically retracted. This behavior is helpful in this example because the two rules are mutually exclusive. In this example, if the person is younger than 18 years old, the rule logically inserts an IsChild fact. After the person is 18 years old or older, the IsChild fact is automatically retracted and the IsAdult fact is inserted. The following DRL rules then determine whether to issue a child bus pass or an adult bus pass and logically insert the ChildBusPass and AdultBusPass facts. This rule configuration is possible because the truth maintenance system in the Drools rule engine supports chaining of logical insertions for a cascading set of retracts. Rules to issue bus pass, logical insertion rule \"Issue Child Bus Pass\" when $p : Person() IsChild(person == $p) then insertLogical(new ChildBusPass($p)); end rule \"Issue Adult Bus Pass\" when $p : Person() IsAdult(person =$p) then insertLogical(new AdultBusPass($p)); end When a person turns 18 years old, the IsChild fact and the person’s ChildBusPass fact is retracted. To these set of conditions, you can relate another rule that states that a person must return the child pass after turning 18 years old. When the Drools rule engine automatically retracts the ChildBusPass object, the following rule is executed to send a request to the person: Rule to notify bus pass holder of new pass rule \"Return ChildBusPass Request\" when $p : Person() not(ChildBusPass(person == $p)) then requestChildBusPass($p); end The following flowcharts illustrate the life cycle of stated and logical insertions: Figure 2. Stated insertion Figure 3. Logical insertion When the Drools rule engine logically inserts an object during a rule execution, the Drools rule engine justifies the object by executing the rule. For each logical insertion, only one equal object can exist, and each subsequent equal logical insertion increases the justification counter for that logical insertion. A justification is removed when the conditions of the rule become untrue. When no more justifications exist, the logical object is automatically retracted. So now we know what inference is, and have a basic example, how does this facilitate good rule design and maintenance? Consider a government ID department that is responsible for issuing ID cards when children become adults. They might have a decision table that includes logic like this, which says when an adult living in London is 18 or over, issue the card: RuleTable ID Card CONDITION CONDITION ACTION p : Person location age >= $1 issueIdCard($1) Select Person Select Adults Issue ID Card Issue ID Card to Adults London 18 p However the ID department does not set the policy on who an adult is. That’s done at a central government level. If the central government were to change that age to 21, this would initiate a change management process. Someone would have to liaise with the ID department and make sure their systems are updated, in time for the law going live. This change management process and communication between departments is not ideal for an agile environment, and change becomes costly and error prone. Also the card department is managing more information than it needs to be aware of with its \"monolithic\" approach to rules management which is \"leaking\" information better placed elsewhere. By this I mean that it doesn’t care what explicit \"age >= 18\" information determines whether someone is an adult, only that they are an adult. In contrast to this, let’s pursue an approach where we split (de-couple) the authoring responsibilities, so that both the central government and the ID department maintain their own rules. It’s the central government’s job to determine who is an adult. If they change the law they just update their central repository with the new rules, which others use: RuleTable Age Policy CONDITION ACTION p : Person age >= $1 insert($1) Adult Age Policy Add Adult Relation Infer Adult 18 new IsAdult( p ) The IsAdult fact, as discussed previously, is inferred from the policy rules. It encapsulates the seemingly arbitrary piece of logic \"age >= 18\" and provides semantic abstractions for its meaning. Now if anyone uses the above rules, they no longer need to be aware of explicit information that determines whether someone is an adult or not. They can just use the inferred fact: RuleTable ID Card CONDITION CONDITION ACTION p : Person isAdult location person == $1 issueIdCard($1) Select Person Select Adults Issue ID Card Issue ID Card to Adults London p p While the example is very minimal and trivial it illustrates some important points. We started with a monolithic and leaky approach to our knowledge engineering. We created a single decision table that had all possible information in it and that leaks information from central government that the ID department did not care about and did not want to manage. We first de-coupled the knowledge process so each department was responsible for only what it needed to know. We then encapsulated this leaky knowledge using an inferred fact IsAdult. The use of the term IsAdult also gave a semantic abstraction to the previously arbitrary logic \"age >= 18\". So a general rule of thumb when doing your knowledge engineering is: Bad Monolithic Leaky Good De-couple knowledge responsibilities Encapsulate knowledge Provide semantic abstractions for those encapsulations The Drools rule engine supports the following fact equality modes that determine how the Drools rule engine stores and compares inserted facts: identity: (Default) The Drools rule engine uses an IdentityHashMap to store all inserted facts. For every new fact insertion, the Drools rule engine returns a new FactHandle object. If a fact is inserted again, the Drools rule engine returns the original FactHandle object, ignoring repeated insertions for the same fact. In this mode, two facts are the same for the Drools rule engine only if they are the very same object with the same identity. equality: The Drools rule engine uses a HashMap to store all inserted facts. The Drools rule engine returns a new FactHandle object only if the inserted fact is not equal to an existing fact, according to the equals() method of the inserted fact. In this mode, two facts are the same for the Drools rule engine if they are composed the same way, regardless of identity. Use this mode when you want objects to be assessed based on feature equality instead of explicit identity. As an illustration of fact equality modes, consider the following example facts: Example facts Person p1 = new Person(\"John\", 45); Person p2 = new Person(\"John\", 45); In identity mode, facts p1 and p2 are different instances of a Person class and are treated as separate objects because they have separate identities. In equality mode, facts p1 and p2 are treated as the same object because they are composed the same way. This difference in behavior affects how you can interact with fact handles. For example, assume that you insert facts p1 and p2 into the Drools rule engine and later you want to retrieve the fact handle for p1. In identity mode, you must specify p1 to return the fact handle for that exact object, whereas in equality mode, you can specify p1, p2, or new Person(\"John\", 45) to return the fact handle. Example code to insert a fact and return the fact handle in identity mode ksession.insert(p1); ksession.getFactHandle(p1); Example code to insert a fact and return the fact handle in equality mode ksession.insert(p1); ksession.getFactHandle(p1); // Alternate option: ksession.getFactHandle(new Person(\"John\", 45)); To set the fact equality mode, use one of the following options: Set the system property drools.equalityBehavior to identity (default) or equality. Set the equality mode while creating the KIE base programmatically: KieServices ks = KieServices.get(); KieBaseConfiguration kieBaseConf = ks.newKieBaseConfiguration(); kieBaseConf.setOption(EqualityBehaviorOption.EQUALITY); KieBase kieBase = kieContainer.newKieBase(kieBaseConf); Set the equality mode in the KIE module descriptor file (kmodule.xml) for a specific Drools project: ... ... ... When new rule data enters the working memory of the Drools rule engine, rules may become fully matched and eligible for execution. A single working memory action can result in multiple eligible rule executions. When a rule is fully matched, the Drools rule engine creates an internalMatch instance, referencing the rule and the matched facts, and adds the internalMatch onto the Drools rule engine agenda. The agenda controls the execution order of these rule internalMatches using a conflict resolution strategy. After the first call of fireAllRules() in the Java application, the Drools rule engine cycles repeatedly through two phases: Agenda evaluation. In this phase, the Drools rule engine selects all rules that can be executed. If no executable rules exist, the execution cycle ends. If an executable rule is found, the Drools rule engine registers the internalMatch in the agenda and then moves on to the working memory actions phase to perform rule consequence actions. Working memory actions. In this phase, the Drools rule engine performs the rule consequence actions (the then portion of each rule) for all activated rules previously registered in the agenda. After all the consequence actions are complete or the main Java application process calls fireAllRules() again, the Drools rule engine returns to the agenda evaluation phase to reassess rules. Figure 4. Two-phase execution process in the Drools rule engine When multiple rules exist on the agenda, the execution of one rule may cause another rule to be removed from the agenda. To avoid this, you can define how and when rules are executed in the Drools rule engine. Some common methods for defining rule execution order are by using rule salience, agenda groups, or internalMatch groups. Each rule has an integer salience attribute that determines the order of execution. Rules with a higher salience value are given higher priority when ordered in the internalMatch queue. The default salience value for rules is zero, but the salience can be negative or positive. For example, the following sample DRL rules are listed in the Drools rule engine stack in the order shown: rule \"RuleA\" salience 95 when $fact : MyFact( field1 == true ) then System.out.println(\"Rule2 : \" + $fact); update($fact); end rule \"RuleB\" salience 100 when $fact : MyFact( field1 == false ) then System.out.println(\"Rule1 : \" + $fact); $fact.setField1(true); update($fact); end The RuleB rule is listed second, but it has a higher salience value than the RuleA rule and is therefore executed first. An agenda group is a set of rules bound together by the same agenda-group rule attribute. Agenda groups partition rules on the Drools rule engine agenda. At any one time, only one group has a focus that gives that group of rules priority for execution before rules in other agenda groups. You determine the focus with a setFocus() call for the agenda group. You can also define rules with an auto-focus attribute so that the next time the rule is activated, the focus is automatically given to the entire agenda group to which the rule is assigned. Each time the setFocus() call is made in a Java application, the Drools rule engine adds the specified agenda group to the top of the rule stack. The default agenda group \"MAIN\" contains all rules that do not belong to a specified agenda group and is executed first in the stack unless another group has the focus. For example, the following sample DRL rules belong to specified agenda groups and are listed in the Drools rule engine stack in the order shown: Sample DRL rules for banking application rule \"Increase balance for credits\" agenda-group \"calculation\" when ap : AccountPeriod() acc : Account( $accountNo : accountNo ) CashFlow( type == CREDIT, accountNo == $accountNo, date >= ap.start && ) tag to your rule and set to LAZY, IMMEDIATE, or EAGER. In the same example rule, the immediate propagation annotation enables the rule to be evaluated only when a String that satisfies the query is inserted before the Integer, as expected: Example rule with a passive query and specified propagation mode query Q (Integer i) String( this == i.toString() ) end rule \"Rule\" @Propagation(IMMEDIATE) when $i : Integer() ?Q( $i; ) then System.out.println( $i ); end Figure 5. AgendaFilters The Drools rule engine supports an AgendaFilter object in the filter interface that you can use to allow or deny the evaluation of specified rules during agenda evaluation. You can specify an agenda filter as part of a fireAllRules() call. The following example code permits only rules ending with the string \"Test\" to be evaluated and executed. All other rules are filtered out of the Drools rule engine agenda. Example agenda filter definition ksession.fireAllRules( new RuleNameEndsWithAgendaFilter( \"Test\" ) ); The Drools rule engine in Drools uses the Phreak algorithm for rule evaluation. Phreak evolved from the Rete algorithm, including the enhanced Rete algorithm ReteOO that was introduced in previous versions of Drools for object-oriented systems. Overall, Phreak is more scalable than Rete and ReteOO, and is faster in large systems. While Rete is considered eager (immediate rule evaluation) and data oriented, Phreak is considered lazy (delayed rule evaluation) and goal oriented. The Rete algorithm performs many actions during the insert, update, and delete actions in order to find partial matches for all rules. This eagerness of the Rete algorithm during rule matching requires a lot of time before eventually executing rules, especially in large systems. With Phreak, this partial matching of rules is delayed deliberately to handle large amounts of data more efficiently. The Phreak algorithm adds the following set of enhancements to previous Rete algorithms: Three layers of contextual memory: Node, segment, and rule memory types Rule-based, segment-based, and node-based linking Lazy (delayed) rule evaluation Stack-based evaluations with pause and resume Isolated rule evaluation Set-oriented propagations When the Drools rule engine starts, all rules are considered to be unlinked from pattern-matching data that can trigger the rules. At this stage, the Phreak algorithm in the Drools rule engine does not evaluate the rules. The insert, update, and delete actions are queued, and Phreak uses a heuristic, based on the rule most likely to result in execution, to calculate and select the next rule for evaluation. When all the required input values are populated for a rule, the rule is considered to be linked to the relevant pattern-matching data. Phreak then creates a goal that represents this rule and places the goal into a priority queue that is ordered by rule salience. Only the rule for which the goal was created is evaluated, and other potential rule evaluations are delayed. While individual rules are evaluated, node sharing is still achieved through the process of segmentation. Unlike the tuple-oriented Rete, the Phreak propagation is collection oriented. For the rule that is being evaluated, the Drools rule engine accesses the first node and processes all queued insert, update, and delete actions. The results are added to a set, and the set is propagated to the child node. In the child node, all queued insert, update, and delete actions are processed, adding the results to the same set. The set is then propagated to the next child node and the same process repeats until it reaches the terminal node. This cycle creates a batch process effect that can provide performance advantages for certain rule constructs. The linking and unlinking of rules happens through a layered bit-mask system, based on network segmentation. When the rule network is built, segments are created for rule network nodes that are shared by the same set of rules. A rule is composed of a path of segments. In case a rule does not share any node with any other rule, it becomes a single segment. A bit-mask offset is assigned to each node in the segment. Another bit mask is assigned to each segment in the path of the rule according to these requirements: If at least one input for a node exists, the node bit is set to the on state. If each node in a segment has the bit set to the on state, the segment bit is also set to the on state. If any node bit is set to the off state, the segment is also set to the off state. If each segment in the path of the rule is set to the on state, the rule is considered linked, and a goal is created to schedule the rule for evaluation. The same bit-mask technique is used to track modified nodes, segments, and rules. This tracking ability enables an already linked rule to be unscheduled from evaluation if it has been modified since the evaluation goal for it was created. As a result, no rules can ever evaluate partial matches. This process of rule evaluation is possible in Phreak because, as opposed to a single unit of memory in Rete, Phreak has three layers of contextual memory with node, segment, and rule memory types. This layering enables much more contextual understanding during the evaluation of a rule. Figure 6. Phreak three-layered memory system The following examples illustrate how rules are organized and evaluated in this three-layered memory system in Phreak. Example 1: A single rule (R1) with three patterns: A, B and C. The rule forms a single segment, with bits 1, 2, and 4 for the nodes. The single segment has a bit offset of 1. Figure 7. Example 1: Single rule Example 2: Rule R2 is added and shares pattern A. Figure 8. Example 2: Two rules with pattern sharing Pattern A is placed in its own segment, resulting in two segments for each rule. Those two segments form a path for their respective rules. The first segment is shared by both paths. When pattern A is linked, the segment becomes linked. The segment then iterates over each path that the segment is shared by, setting the bit 1 to on. If patterns B and C are later turned on, the second segment for path R1 is linked, and this causes bit 2 to be turned on for R1. With bit 1 and bit 2 turned on for R1, the rule is now linked and a goal is created to schedule the rule for later evaluation and execution. When a rule is evaluated, the segments enable the results of the matching to be shared. Each segment has a staging memory to queue all inserts, updates, and deletes for that segment. When R1 is evaluated, the rule processes pattern A, and this results in a set of tuples. The algorithm detects a segmentation split, creates peered tuples for each insert, update, and delete in the set, and adds them to the R2 staging memory. Those tuples are then merged with any existing staged tuples and are executed when R2 is eventually evaluated. Example 3: Rules R3 and R4 are added and share patterns A and B. Figure 9. Example 3: Three rules with pattern sharing Rules R3 and R4 have three segments and R1 has two segments. Patterns A and B are shared by R1, R3, and R4, while pattern D is shared by R3 and R4. Example 4: A single rule (R1) with a subnetwork and no pattern sharing. Figure 10. Example 4: Single rule with a subnetwork and no pattern sharing Subnetworks are formed when a Not, Exists, or Accumulate node contains more than one element. In this example, the element B not( C ) forms the subnetwork. The element not( C ) is a single element that does not require a subnetwork and is therefore merged inside of the Not node. The subnetwork uses a dedicated segment. Rule R1 still has a path of two segments and the subnetwork forms another inner path. When the subnetwork is linked, it is also linked in the outer segment. Example 5: Rule R1 with a subnetwork that is shared by rule R2. Figure 11. Example 5: Two rules, one with a subnetwork and pattern sharing The subnetwork nodes in a rule can be shared by another rule that does not have a subnetwork. This sharing causes the subnetwork segment to be split into two segments. Constrained Not nodes and Accumulate nodes can never unlink a segment, and are always considered to have their bits turned on. The Phreak evaluation algorithm is stack based instead of method-recursion based. Rule evaluation can be paused and resumed at any time when a StackEntry is used to represent the node currently being evaluated. When a rule evaluation reaches a subnetwork, a StackEntry object is created for the outer path segment and the subnetwork segment. The subnetwork segment is evaluated first, and when the set reaches the end of the subnetwork path, the segment is merged into a staging list for the outer node that the segment feeds into. The previous StackEntry object is then resumed and can now process the results of the subnetwork. This process has the added benefit, especially for Accumulate nodes, that all work is completed in a batch, before propagating to the child node. The same stack system is used for efficient backward chaining. When a rule evaluation reaches a query node, the evaluation is paused and the query is added to the stack. The query is then evaluated to produce a result set, which is saved in a memory location for the resumed StackEntry object to pick up and propagate to the child node. If the query itself called other queries, the process repeats, while the current query is paused and a new evaluation is set up for the current query node. The Drools rule engine in Drools is a hybrid reasoning system that uses both forward chaining and backward chaining to evaluate rules. A forward-chaining rule system is a data-driven system that starts with a fact in the working memory of the Drools rule engine and reacts to changes to that fact. When objects are inserted into working memory, any rule conditions that become true as a result of the change are scheduled for execution by the agenda. In contrast, a backward-chaining rule system is a goal-driven system that starts with a conclusion that the Drools rule engine attempts to satisfy, often using recursion. If the system cannot reach the conclusion or goal, it searches for subgoals, which are conclusions that complete part of the current goal. The system continues this process until either the initial conclusion is satisfied or all subgoals are satisfied. The following diagram illustrates how the Drools rule engine evaluates rules using forward chaining overall with a backward-chaining segment in the logic flow: Figure 12. Rule evaluation logic using forward and backward chaining Drools contains a RuleBaseConfiguration.java object that you can use to configure exception handler settings, multithreaded execution, and sequential mode in the Drools rule engine. For the rule base configuration options, see the Drools RuleBaseConfiguration.java page in GitHub. The following rule base configuration options are available for the Drools rule engine: drools.consequenceExceptionHandler When configured, this system property defines the class that manages the exceptions thrown by rule consequences. You can use this property to specify a custom exception handler for rule evaluation in the Drools rule engine. Default value: org.drools.core.runtime.rule.impl.DefaultConsequenceExceptionHandler You can specify the custom exception handler using one of the following options: Specify the exception handler in a system property: drools.consequenceExceptionHandler=org.drools.core.runtime.rule.impl.MyCustomConsequenceExceptionHandler Specify the exception handler while creating the KIE base programmatically: KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieBaseConfiguration kieBaseConf = ks.newKieBaseConfiguration(); kieBaseConf.setOption(ConsequenceExceptionHandlerOption.get(MyCustomConsequenceExceptionHandler.class)); KieBase kieBase = kieContainer.newKieBase(kieBaseConf); drools.parallelExecution When in use, this system property allows the Drools rule engine to only evaluate or both evaluate and execute rules in parallel by dividing the Phreak rule network into independent partitions. You can use this property to increase the speed of rule evaluation for specific rule bases. This option has 3 possible values: sequential : evaluates and executes all rules sequentially parallel_evaluation : evaluates rules in parallel but fires consequence sequentially respecting the semantic imposed by salience and agenda-groups. fully_parallel : evaluates and executes everything in parallel Default value: sequential You can enable parallel evaluation using one of the following options: Enable the parallel evaluation system property: drools.parallelExecution=fully_parallel Enable parallel evaluation while creating the KIE base programmatically: KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieBaseConfiguration kieBaseConf = ks.newKieBaseConfiguration(); kieBaseConf.setOption(ParallelExecutionOption.FULLY_PARALLEL); KieBase kieBase = kieContainer.newKieBase(kieBaseConf); In fully_parallel mode rules that use queries, salience, or agenda groups are currently not supported by the parallel Drools rule engine. If these rule elements are present in the KIE base, the compiler emits a warning and automatically switches back to a single-threaded evaluation. However, in some cases, the Drools rule engine might not detect the unsupported rule elements and rules might be evaluated incorrectly. For example, the Drools rule engine might not detect when rules rely on implicit salience given by rule ordering inside the DRL file, resulting in incorrect evaluation due to the unsupported salience attribute. drools.sequential When enabled, this system property enables sequential mode in the Drools rule engine. In sequential mode, the Drools rule engine evaluates rules one time in the order that they are listed in the Drools rule engine agenda without regard to changes in the working memory. This means that the Drools rule engine ignores any insert, modify, or update statements in rules and executes rules in a single sequence. As a result, rule execution may be faster in sequential mode, but important updates may not be applied to your rules. You can use this property if you use stateless KIE sessions and you do not want the execution of rules to influence subsequent rules in the agenda. Sequential mode applies to stateless KIE sessions only. Default value: false You can enable sequential mode using one of the following options: Enable the sequential mode system property: drools.sequential=true Enable sequential mode while creating the KIE base programmatically: KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieBaseConfiguration kieBaseConf = ks.newKieBaseConfiguration(); kieBaseConf.setOption(SequentialOption.YES); KieBase kieBase = kieContainer.newKieBase(kieBaseConf); Enable sequential mode in the KIE module descriptor file (kmodule.xml) for a specific Drools project: ... ... ... Sequential mode is an advanced rule base configuration in the Drools rule engine, supported by Phreak, that enables the Drools rule engine to evaluate rules one time in the order that they are listed in the Drools rule engine agenda without regard to changes in the working memory. In sequential mode, the Drools rule engine ignores any insert, modify, or update statements in rules and executes rules in a single sequence. As a result, rule execution may be faster in sequential mode, but important updates may not be applied to your rules. Sequential mode applies to only stateless KIE sessions because stateful KIE sessions inherently use data from previously invoked KIE sessions. If you use a stateless KIE session and you want the execution of rules to influence subsequent rules in the agenda, then do not enable sequential mode. Sequential mode is disabled by default in the Drools rule engine. To enable sequential mode, use one of the following options: Set the system property drools.sequential to true. Enable sequential mode while creating the KIE base programmatically: KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieBaseConfiguration kieBaseConf = ks.newKieBaseConfiguration(); kieBaseConf.setOption(SequentialOption.YES); KieBase kieBase = kieContainer.newKieBase(kieBaseConf); Enable sequential mode in the KIE module descriptor file (kmodule.xml) for a specific Drools project: ... ... ... To configure sequential mode to use a dynamic agenda, use one of the following options: Set the system property drools.sequential.agenda to dynamic. Set the sequential agenda option while creating the KIE base programmatically: KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get(); KieBaseConfiguration kieBaseConf = ks.newKieBaseConfiguration(); kieBaseConf.setOption(SequentialAgendaOption.DYNAMIC); KieBase kieBase = kieContainer.newKieBase(kieBaseConf); When you enable sequential mode, the Drools rule engine evaluates rules in the following way: Rules are ordered by salience and position in the rule set. An element for each possible rule match is created. The element position indicates the execution order. Node memory is disabled, with the exception of the right-input object memory. The left-input adapter node propagation is disconnected and the object with the node is referenced in a Command object. The Command object is added to a list in the working memory for later execution. All objects are asserted, and then the list of Command objects is checked and executed. All matches that result from executing the list are added to elements based on the sequence number of the rule. The elements that contain matches are executed in a sequence. If you set a maximum number of rule executions, the Drools rule engine activates no more than that number of rules in the agenda for execution. In sequential mode, the LeftInputAdapterNode node creates a Command object and adds it to a list in the working memory of the Drools rule engine. This Command object contains references to the LeftInputAdapterNode node and the propagated object. These references stop any left-input propagations at insertion time so that the right-input propagation never needs to attempt to join the left inputs. The references also avoid the need for the left-input memory. All nodes have their memory turned off, including the left-input tuple memory, but excluding the right-input object memory. After all the assertions are finished and the right-input memory of all the objects is populated, the Drools rule engine iterates over the list of LeftInputAdatperNode Command objects. The objects propagate down the network, attempting to join the right-input objects, but they are not retained in the left input. The agenda with a priority queue to schedule the tuples is replaced by an element for each rule. The sequence number of the RuleTerminalNode node indicates the element where to place the match. After all Command objects have finished, the elements are checked and existing matches are executed. To improve performance, the first and the last populated cell in the elements are retained. When the network is constructed, each RuleTerminalNode node receives a sequence number based on its salience number and the order in which it was added to the network. The right-input node memories are typically hash maps for fast object deletion. Because object deletions are not supported, Phreak uses an object list when the values of the object are not indexed. For a large number of objects, indexed hash maps provide a performance increase. If an object has only a few instances, Phreak uses an object list instead of an index. In Drools, an event is a record of a significant change of state in the application domain at a point in time. Depending on how the domain is modeled, the change of state may be represented by a single event, multiple atomic events, or hierarchies of correlated events. From a complex event processing (CEP) perspective, an event is a type of fact or object that occurs at a specific point in time, and a business rule is a definition of how to react to the data from that fact or object. For example, in a stock broker application, a change in security prices, a change in ownership from seller to buyer, or a change in an account holder’s balance are all considered to be events because a change has occurred in the state of the application domain at a given time. The Drools rule engine in Drools uses complex event processing (CEP) to detect and process multiple events within a collection of events, to uncover relationships that exist between events, and to infer new data from the events and their relationships. CEP use cases share several requirements and goals with business rule use cases. From a business perspective, business rule definitions are often defined based on the occurrence of scenarios triggered by events. In the following examples, events form the basis of business rules: In an algorithmic trading application, a rule performs an action if the security price increases by X percent above the day opening price. The price increases are denoted by events on a stock trading application. In a monitoring application, a rule performs an action if the temperature in the server room increases X degrees in Y minutes. The sensor readings are denoted by events. From a technical perspective, business rule evaluation and CEP have the following key similarities: Both business rule evaluation and CEP require seamless integration with the enterprise infrastructure and applications. This is particularly important with life-cycle management, auditing, and security. Both business rule evaluation and CEP have functional requirements such as pattern matching, and non-functional requirements such as response time limits and query-rule explanations. CEP scenarios have the following key characteristics: Scenarios usually process large numbers of events, but only a small percentage of the events are relevant. Events are usually immutable and represent a record of change in state. Rules and queries run against events and must react to detected event patterns. Related events usually have a strong temporal relationship. Individual events are not prioritized. The CEP system prioritizes patterns of related events and the relationships between them. Events usually need to be composed and aggregated. Given these common CEP scenario characteristics, the CEP system in Drools supports the following features and functions to optimize event processing: Event processing with proper semantics Event detection, correlation, aggregation, and composition Event stream processing Temporal constraints to model the temporal relationships between events Sliding windows of significant events Session-scoped unified clock Required volumes of events for CEP use cases Reactive rules Adapters for event input into the Drools rule engine (pipeline) In Drools, an event is a record of a significant change of state in the application domain at a point in time. Depending on how the domain is modeled, the change of state may be represented by a single event, multiple atomic events, or hierarchies of correlated events. From a complex event processing (CEP) perspective, an event is a type of fact or object that occurs at a specific point in time, and a business rule is a definition of how to react to the data from that fact or object. For example, in a stock broker application, a change in security prices, a change in ownership from seller to buyer, or a change in an account holder’s balance are all considered to be events because a change has occurred in the state of the application domain at a given time. Events have the following key characteristics: Are immutable: An event is a record of change that has occurred at some time in the past and cannot be changed. The Drools rule engine does not enforce immutability on the Java objects that represent events. This behavior makes event data enrichment possible. Your application should be able to populate unpopulated event attributes, and these attributes are used by the Drools rule engine to enrich the event with inferred data. However, you should not change event attributes that have already been populated. Have strong temporal constraints: Rules involving events usually require the correlation of multiple events that occur at different points in time relative to each other. Have managed life cycles: Because events are immutable and have temporal constraints, they are usually only relevant for a specified period of time. This means that the Drools rule engine can automatically manage the life cycle of events. Can use sliding windows: You can define sliding windows of time or length with events. A sliding time window is a specified period of time during which events can be processed. A sliding length window is a specified number of events that can be processed. You can declare facts as events in your Java class or DRL rule file so that the Drools rule engine handles the facts as events during complex event processing. You can declare the facts as interval-based events or point-in-time events. Interval-based events have a duration time and persist in the working memory of the Drools rule engine until their duration time has lapsed. Point-in-time events have no duration and are essentially interval-based events with a duration of zero. Procedure For the relevant fact type in your Java class or DRL rule file, enter the @role( event ) metadata tag and parameter. The @role metadata tag accepts the following two values: fact: (Default) Declares the type as a regular fact event: Declares the type as an event For example, the following snippet declares that the StockPoint fact type in a stock broker application must be handled as an event: Declare fact type as an event import some.package.StockPoint declare StockPoint @role( event ) end If StockPoint is a fact type declared in the DRL rule file instead of in a pre-existing class, you can declare the event in-line in your application code: Declare fact type in-line and assign it to event role declare StockPoint @role( event ) datetime : java.util.Date symbol : String price : double end The Drools rule engine runs in either cloud mode or stream mode. In cloud mode, the Drools rule engine processes facts as facts with no temporal constraints, independent of time, and in no particular order. In stream mode, the Drools rule engine processes facts as events with strong temporal constraints, in real time or near real time. Stream mode uses synchronization to make event processing possible in Drools. Cloud mode Cloud mode is the default operating mode of the Drools rule engine. In cloud mode, the Drools rule engine treats events as an unordered cloud. Events still have time stamps, but the Drools rule engine running in cloud mode cannot draw relevance from the time stamp because cloud mode ignores the present time. This mode uses the rule constraints to find the matching tuples to activate and execute rules. Cloud mode does not impose any kind of additional requirements on facts. However, because the Drools rule engine in this mode has no concept of time, it cannot use temporal features such as sliding windows or automatic life-cycle management. In cloud mode, events must be explicitly retracted when they are no longer needed. The following requirements are not imposed in cloud mode: No clock synchronization because the Drools rule engine has no notion of time No ordering of events because the Drools rule engine processes events as an unordered cloud, against which the Drools rule engine match rules You can specify cloud mode either by setting the system property in the relevant configuration files or by using the Java client API: Set cloud mode using system property drools.eventProcessingMode=cloud Set cloud mode using Java client API import org.kie.api.conf.EventProcessingOption; import org.kie.api.KieBaseConfiguration; import org.kie.api.KieServices.Factory; KieBaseConfiguration config = KieServices.Factory.get().newKieBaseConfiguration(); config.setOption(EventProcessingOption.CLOUD); You can also specify cloud mode using the eventProcessingMode=\"\" KIE base attribute in the KIE module descriptor file (kmodule.xml) for a specific Drools project: Set cloud mode using project kmodule.xml file ... ... ... Stream mode Stream mode enables the Drools rule engine to process events chronologically and in real time as they are inserted into the Drools rule engine. In stream mode, the Drools rule engine synchronizes streams of events (so that events in different streams can be processed in chronological order), implements sliding windows of time or length, and enables automatic life-cycle management. The following requirements apply to stream mode: Events in each stream must be ordered chronologically. A session clock must be present to synchronize event streams. Your application does not need to enforce ordering events between streams, but using event streams that have not been synchronized may cause unexpected results. You can specify stream mode either by setting the system property in the relevant configuration files or by using the Java client API: Set stream mode using system property drools.eventProcessingMode=stream Set stream mode using Java client API import org.kie.api.conf.EventProcessingOption; import org.kie.api.KieBaseConfiguration; import org.kie.api.KieServices.Factory; KieBaseConfiguration config = KieServices.Factory.get().newKieBaseConfiguration(); config.setOption(EventProcessingOption.STREAM); You can also specify stream mode using the eventProcessingMode=\"\" KIE base attribute in the KIE module descriptor file (kmodule.xml) for a specific Drools project: Set stream mode using project kmodule.xml file ... ... ... A negative pattern is a pattern for conditions that are not met. For example, the following DRL rule activates a fire alarm if a fire is detected and the sprinkler is not activated: Fire alarm rule with a negative pattern rule \"Sound the alarm\" when $f : FireDetected() not(SprinklerActivated()) then // Sound the alarm. end In cloud mode, the Drools rule engine assumes all facts (regular facts and events) are known in advance and evaluates negative patterns immediately. In stream mode, the Drools rule engine can support temporal constraints on facts to wait for a set time before activating a rule. The same example rule in stream mode activates the fire alarm as usual, but applies a 10-second delay. Fire alarm rule with a negative pattern and time delay (stream mode only) rule \"Sound the alarm\" when $f : FireDetected() not(SprinklerActivated(this after[0s,10s] $f)) then // Sound the alarm. end The following modified fire alarm rule expects one Heartbeat event to occur every 10 seconds. If the expected event does not occur, the rule is executed. This rule uses the same type of object in both the first pattern and in the negative pattern. The negative pattern has the temporal constraint to wait 0 to 10 seconds before executing and excludes the Heartbeat event bound to $h so that the rule can be executed. The bound event $h must be explicitly excluded in order for the rule to be executed because the temporal constraint [0s, …​] does not inherently exclude that event from being matched again. Fire alarm rule excluding a bound event in a negative pattern (stream mode only) rule \"Sound the alarm\" when $h: Heartbeat() from entry-point \"MonitoringStream\" not(Heartbeat(this != $h, this after[0s,10s] $h) from entry-point \"MonitoringStream\") then // Sound the alarm. end By default, the Drools rule engine does not re-evaluate all fact patterns for fact types each time a rule is triggered, but instead reacts only to modified properties that are constrained or bound inside a given pattern. For example, if a rule calls modify() as part of the rule actions but the action does not generate new data in the KIE base, the Drools rule engine does not automatically re-evaluate all fact patterns because no data was modified. This property reactivity behavior prevents unwanted recursions in the KIE base and results in more efficient rule evaluation. This behavior also means that you do not always need to use the no-loop rule attribute to avoid infinite recursion. You can modify or disable this property reactivity behavior with the following KnowledgeBuilderConfiguration options, and then use a property-change setting in your Java class or DRL files to fine-tune property reactivity as needed: ALWAYS: (Default) All types are property reactive, but you can disable property reactivity for a specific type by using the @classReactive property-change setting. ALLOWED: No types are property reactive, but you can enable property reactivity for a specific type by using the @propertyReactive property-change setting. DISABLED: No types are property reactive. All property-change listeners are ignored. Example property reactivity setting in KnowledgeBuilderConfiguration KnowledgeBuilderConfiguration config = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilderConfiguration(); config.setOption(PropertySpecificOption.ALLOWED); KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder(config); Alternatively, you can update the drools.propertySpecific system property in the standalone.xml file of your Drools distribution: Example property reactivity setting in system properties ... ... The Drools rule engine supports the following property-change settings and listeners for fact classes or declared DRL fact types: @classReactive If property reactivity is set to ALWAYS in the Drools rule engine (all types are property reactive), this tag disables the default property reactivity behavior for a specific Java class or a declared DRL fact type. You can use this tag if you want the Drools rule engine to re-evaluate all fact patterns for the specified fact type each time the rule is triggered, instead of reacting only to modified properties that are constrained or bound inside a given pattern. Example: Disable default property reactivity in a DRL type declaration declare Person @classReactive firstName : String lastName : String end Example: Disable default property reactivity in a Java class @classReactive public static class Person { private String firstName; private String lastName; } @propertyReactive If property reactivity is set to ALLOWED in the Drools rule engine (no types are property reactive unless specified), this tag enables property reactivity for a specific Java class or a declared DRL fact type. You can use this tag if you want the Drools rule engine to react only to modified properties that are constrained or bound inside a given pattern for the specified fact type, instead of re-evaluating all fact patterns for the fact each time the rule is triggered. Example: Enable property reactivity in a DRL type declaration (when reactivity is disabled globally) declare Person @propertyReactive firstName : String lastName : String end Example: Enable property reactivity in a Java class (when reactivity is disabled globally) @propertyReactive public static class Person { private String firstName; private String lastName; } @watch This tag enables property reactivity for additional properties that you specify in-line in fact patterns in DRL rules. This tag is supported only if property reactivity is set to ALWAYS in the Drools rule engine, or if property reactivity is set to ALLOWED and the relevant fact type uses the @propertyReactive tag. You can use this tag in DRL rules to add or exclude specific properties in fact property reactivity logic. Default parameter: None Supported parameters: Property name, * (all), ! (not), !* (no properties) @watch ( ) Example: Enable or disable property reactivity in fact patterns // Listens for changes in both `firstName` (inferred) and `lastName`: Person(firstName == $expectedFirstName) @watch( lastName ) // Listens for changes in all properties of the `Person` fact: Person(firstName == $expectedFirstName) @watch( * ) // Listens for changes in `lastName` and explicitly excludes changes in `firstName`: Person(firstName == $expectedFirstName) @watch( lastName, !firstName ) // Listens for changes in all properties of the `Person` fact except `age`: Person(firstName == $expectedFirstName) @watch( *, !age ) // Excludes changes in all properties of the `Person` fact (equivalent to using `@classReactivity` tag): Person(firstName == $expectedFirstName) @watch( !* ) The Drools rule engine generates a compilation error if you use the @watch tag for properties in a fact type that uses the @classReactive tag (disables property reactivity) or when property reactivity is set to ALLOWED in the Drools rule engine and the relevant fact type does not use the @propertyReactive tag. Compilation errors also arise if you duplicate properties in listener annotations, such as @watch( firstName, ! firstName ). @propertyChangeSupport For facts that implement support for property changes as defined in the JavaBeans Specification, this tag enables the Drools rule engine to monitor changes in the fact properties. Example: Declare property change support in JavaBeans object declare Person @propertyChangeSupport end In stream mode, the Drools rule engine supports the following temporal operators for events that are inserted into the working memory of the Drools rule engine. You can use these operators to define the temporal reasoning behavior of the events that you declare in your Java class or DRL rule file. Temporal operators are not supported when the Drools rule engine is running in cloud mode. after before coincides during includes finishes finished by meets met by overlaps overlapped by starts started by after This operator specifies if the current event occurs after the correlated event. This operator can also define an amount of time after which the current event can follow the correlated event, or a delimiting time range during which the current event can follow the correlated event. For example, the following pattern matches if $eventA starts between 3 minutes and 30 seconds and 4 minutes after $eventB finishes. If $eventA starts earlier than 3 minutes and 30 seconds after $eventB finishes, or later than 4 minutes after $eventB finishes, then the pattern is not matched. $eventA : EventA(this after[3m30s, 4m] $eventB) You can also express this operator in the following way: 3m30s $eventB.endTimestamp The started by operator supports one optional parameter that sets the maximum distance between the start times of the two events: $eventA : EventA( this starts[5s] $eventB) This pattern matches if these conditions are met: abs( $eventA.startTimestamp - $eventB.startTimestamp ) $eventB.endTimestamp The Drools rule engine does not support negative intervals for the started by operator. If you use negative intervals, the Drools rule engine generates an error. During complex event processing, events in the Drools rule engine may have temporal constraints and therefore require a session clock that provides the current time. For example, if a rule needs to determine the average price of a given stock over the last 60 minutes, the Drools rule engine must be able to compare the stock price event time stamp with the current time in the session clock. The Drools rule engine supports a real-time clock and a pseudo clock. You can use one or both clock types depending on the scenario: Rules testing: Testing requires a controlled environment, and when the tests include rules with temporal constraints, you must be able to control the input rules and facts and the flow of time. Regular execution: The Drools rule engine reacts to events in real time and therefore requires a real-time clock. Special environments: Specific environments may have specific time control requirements. For example, clustered environments may require clock synchronization or Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) environments may require a clock provided by the application server. Rules replay or simulation: In order to replay or simulate scenarios, the application must be able to control the flow of time. Consider your environment requirements as you decide whether to use a real-time clock or pseudo clock in the Drools rule engine. Real-time clock The real-time clock is the default clock implementation in the Drools rule engine and uses the system clock to determine the current time for time stamps. To configure the Drools rule engine to use the real-time clock, set the KIE session configuration parameter to realtime: Configure real-time clock in KIE session import org.kie.api.KieServices.Factory; import org.kie.api.runtime.conf.ClockTypeOption; import org.kie.api.runtime.KieSessionConfiguration; KieSessionConfiguration config = KieServices.Factory.get().newKieSessionConfiguration(); config.setOption(ClockTypeOption.get(\"realtime\")); Pseudo clock The pseudo clock implementation in the Drools rule engine is helpful for testing temporal rules and it can be controlled by the application. To configure the Drools rule engine to use the pseudo clock, set the KIE session configuration parameter to pseudo: Configure pseudo clock in KIE session import org.kie.api.runtime.conf.ClockTypeOption; import org.kie.api.runtime.KieSessionConfiguration; import org.kie.api.KieServices.Factory; KieSessionConfiguration config = KieServices.Factory.get().newKieSessionConfiguration(); config.setOption(ClockTypeOption.get(\"pseudo\")); You can also use additional configurations and fact handlers to control the pseudo clock: Control pseudo clock behavior in KIE session import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; import org.kie.api.runtime.KieSessionConfiguration; import org.kie.api.KieServices.Factory; import org.kie.api.runtime.KieSession; import org.drools.core.time.SessionPseudoClock; import org.kie.api.runtime.rule.FactHandle; import org.kie.api.runtime.conf.ClockTypeOption; KieSessionConfiguration conf = KieServices.Factory.get().newKieSessionConfiguration(); conf.setOption( ClockTypeOption.get(\"pseudo\")); KieSession session = kbase.newKieSession(conf, null); SessionPseudoClock clock = session.getSessionClock(); // While inserting facts, advance the clock as necessary. FactHandle handle1 = session.insert(tick1); clock.advanceTime(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); FactHandle handle2 = session.insert(tick2); clock.advanceTime(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS); FactHandle handle3 = session.insert(tick3); The Drools rule engine can process high volumes of events in the form of event streams. In DRL rule declarations, a stream is also known as an entry point. When you declare an entry point in a DRL rule or Java application, the Drools rule engine, at compile time, identifies and creates the proper internal structures to use data from only that entry point to evaluate that rule. Facts from one entry point, or stream, can join facts from any other entry point in addition to facts already in the working memory of the Drools rule engine. Facts always remain associated with the entry point through which they entered the Drools rule engine. Facts of the same type can enter the Drools rule engine through several entry points, but facts that enter the Drools rule engine through entry point A can never match a pattern from entry point B. Event streams have the following characteristics: Events in the stream are ordered by time stamp. The time stamps may have different semantics for different streams, but they are always ordered internally. Event streams usually have a high volume of events. Atomic events in streams are usually not useful individually, only collectively in a stream. Event streams can be homogeneous and contain a single type of event, or heterogeneous and contain events of different types. You can declare an entry point (event stream) for events so that the Drools rule engine uses data from only that entry point to evaluate the rules. You can declare an entry point either implicitly by referencing it in DRL rules or explicitly in your Java application. Procedure Use one of the following methods to declare the entry point: In the DRL rule file, specify from entry-point \"\" for the inserted fact: Authorize withdrawal rule with \"ATM Stream\" entry point rule \"Authorize withdrawal\" when WithdrawRequest($ai : accountId, $am : amount) from entry-point \"ATM Stream\" CheckingAccount(accountId == $ai, balance > $am) then // Authorize withdrawal. end Apply fee rule with \"Branch Stream\" entry point rule \"Apply fee on withdraws on branches\" when WithdrawRequest($ai : accountId, processed == true) from entry-point \"Branch Stream\" CheckingAccount(accountId == $ai) then // Apply a $2 fee on the account. end Both example DRL rules from a banking application insert the event WithdrawalRequest with the fact CheckingAccount, but from different entry points. At run time, the Drools rule engine evaluates the Authorize withdrawal rule using data from only the \"ATM Stream\" entry point, and evaluates the Apply fee rule using data from only the \"Branch Stream\" entry point. Any events inserted into the \"ATM Stream\" can never match patterns for the \"Apply fee\" rule, and any events inserted into the \"Branch Stream\" can never match patterns for the \"Authorize withdrawal rule\". In the Java application code, use the getEntryPoint() method to specify and obtain an EntryPoint object and insert facts into that entry point accordingly: Java application code with EntryPoint object and inserted facts import org.kie.api.runtime.KieSession; import org.kie.api.runtime.rule.EntryPoint; // Create your KIE base and KIE session as usual. KieSession session = ... // Create a reference to the entry point. EntryPoint atmStream = session.getEntryPoint(\"ATM Stream\"); // Start inserting your facts into the entry point. atmStream.insert(aWithdrawRequest); Any DRL rules that specify from entry-point \"ATM Stream\" are then evaluated based on the data in this entry point only. In stream mode, the Drools rule engine can process events from a specified sliding window of time or length. A sliding time window is a specified period of time during which events can be processed. A sliding length window is a specified number of events that can be processed. When you declare a sliding window in a DRL rule or Java application, the Drools rule engine, at compile time, identifies and creates the proper internal structures to use data from only that sliding window to evaluate that rule. For example, the following DRL rule snippets instruct the Drools rule engine to process only the stock points from the last 2 minutes (sliding time window) or to process only the last 10 stock points (sliding length window): Process stock points from the last 2 minutes (sliding time window) StockPoint() over window:time(2m) Process the last 10 stock points (sliding length window) StockPoint() over window:length(10) You can declare a sliding window of time (flow of time) or length (number of occurrences) for events so that the Drools rule engine uses data from only that window to evaluate the rules. Procedure In the DRL rule file, specify over window:() for the inserted fact. For example, the following two DRL rules activate a fire alarm based on an average temperature. However, the first rule uses a sliding time window to calculate the average over the last 10 minutes while the second rule uses a sliding length window to calculate the average over the last one hundred temperature readings. Average temperature over sliding time window rule \"Sound the alarm if temperature rises above threshold\" when TemperatureThreshold($max : max) Number(doubleValue > $max) from accumulate( SensorReading($temp : temperature) over window:time(10m), average($temp)) then // Sound the alarm. end Average temperature over sliding length window rule \"Sound the alarm if temperature rises above threshold\" when TemperatureThreshold($max : max) Number(doubleValue > $max) from accumulate( SensorReading($temp : temperature) over window:length(100), average($temp)) then // Sound the alarm. end The Drools rule engine discards any SensorReading events that are more than 10 minutes old or that are not part of the last one hundred readings, and continues recalculating the average as the minutes or readings \"slide\" forward in real time. The Drools rule engine does not automatically remove outdated events from the KIE session because other rules without sliding window declarations might depend on those events. The Drools rule engine stores events in the KIE session until the events expire either by explicit rule declarations or by implicit reasoning within the Drools rule engine based on inferred data in the KIE base. In stream mode, the Drools rule engine uses automatic memory management to maintain events that are stored in KIE sessions. The Drools rule engine can retract from a KIE session any events that no longer match any rule due to their temporal constraints and release any resources held by the retracted events. The Drools rule engine uses either explicit or inferred expiration to retract outdated events: Explicit expiration: The Drools rule engine removes events that are explicitly set to expire in rules that declare the @expires tag: DRL rule snippet with explicit expiration declare StockPoint @expires( 30m ) end This example rule sets any StockPoint events to expire after 30 minutes and to be removed from the KIE session if no other rules use the events. By default the expiration defined in this way is a hard expiration, which means that the Drools rule engine removes the event from the session immediately after this expiration time, regardless if there are rules that could still match the event. You can also define a soft expiration, which means that the Drools rule engine removes the event from the session only if no other rules use the event. It is possible to define a soft expiration policy for an event as it follows. declare StockPoint @expires( 30m, policy = TIME_SOFT ) end Inferred expiration: The Drools rule engine can calculate the expiration offset for a given event implicitly by analyzing the temporal constraints in the rules: DRL rule with temporal constraints rule \"Correlate orders\" when $bo : BuyOrder($id : id) $ae : AckOrder(id == $id, this after[0,10s] $bo) then // Perform an action. end For this example rule, the Drools rule engine automatically calculates that whenever a BuyOrder event occurs, the Drools rule engine needs to store the event for up to 10 seconds and wait for the matching AckOrder event. After 10 seconds, the Drools rule engine infers the expiration and removes the event from the KIE session. An AckOrder event can only match an existing BuyOrder event, so the Drools rule engine infers the expiration if no match occurs and removes the event immediately. The same is applied to a sliding window of time window:time(), but a sliding window of length window:length() doesn’t calculate its expiration. The Drools rule engine analyzes the entire KIE base to find the offset for every event type and to ensure that no other rules use the events that are pending removal. Whenever an implicit expiration clashes with an explicit expiration value, the explict one takes precedence if is hard (the default) while the implicit expiration is taken into account if the explicit one is defined as soft. You can use queries with the Drools rule engine to retrieve fact sets based on fact patterns as they are used in rules. The patterns might also use optional parameters. To use queries with the Drools rule engine, you add the query definitions in DRL files and then obtain the matching results in your application code. While a query iterates over a result collection, you can use any identifier that is bound to the query to access the corresponding fact or fact field by calling the get() method with the binding variable name as the argument. If the binding refers to a fact object, you can retrieve the fact handle by calling getFactHandle() with the variable name as the parameter. Figure 13. QueryResults Figure 14.

Example log4j.xml configuration file in org.drools package ... If you are developing for an ultra light environment, use the slf4j-nop or slf4j-simple logger. The following key concepts or suggested practices can help you optimize Drools rule engine performance. These concepts are summarized in this section as a convenience and are explained in more detail in the cross-referenced documentation, where applicable. This section will expand or change as needed with new releases of Drools. Use sequential mode for stateless KIE sessions that do not require important Drools rule engine updates Sequential mode is an advanced rule base configuration in the Drools rule engine that enables the Drools rule engine to evaluate rules one time in the order that they are listed in the Drools rule engine agenda without regard to changes in the working memory. As a result, rule execution may be faster in sequential mode, but important updates may not be applied to your rules. Sequential mode applies to stateless KIE sessions only. To enable sequential mode, set the system property drools.sequential to true. For more information about sequential mode or other options for enabling it, see Sequential mode in Phreak. Use simple operations with event listeners Limit the number of event listeners and the type of operations they perform. Use event listeners for simple operations, such as debug logging and setting properties. Complicated operations, such as network calls, in listeners can impede rule execution. After you finish working with a KIE session, remove the attached event listeners so that the session can be cleaned, as shown in the following example: Example event listener removed after use Listener listener = ...; StatelessKnowledgeSession ksession = createSession(); try { ksession.insert(fact); ksession.fireAllRules(); ... } finally { if (session != null) { ksession.detachListener(listener); ksession.dispose(); } } For information about built-in event listeners and debug logging in the Drools rule engine, see Drools rule engine event listeners and debug logging. Configure LambdaIntrospector cache size for an executable model build You can configure the size of LambdaIntrospector.methodFingerprintsMap cache, which is used in an executable model build. The default size of the cache is 32. When you configure smaller value for the cache size, it reduces memory usage. For example, you can configure system property drools.lambda.introspector.cache.size to 0 for minimum memory usage. Note that smaller cache size also slows down the build performance. Use lambda externalization for executable model Enable lambda externalization to optimize the memory consumption during runtime. It rewrites lambdas that are generated and used in the executable model. This enables you to reuse the same lambda multiple times with all the patterns and the same constraint. When the rete or phreak is instantiated, the executable model becomes garbage collectible. To enable lambda externalization for the executable model, include the following property: -Ddrools.externaliseCanonicalModelLambda=true Configure alpha node range index threshold Alpha node range index is used to evaluate the rule constraint. You can configure the threshold of the alpha node range index using the drools.alphaNodeRangeIndexThreshold system property. The default value of the threshold is 9, indicating that the alpha node range index is enabled when a precedent node contains more than nine alpha nodes with inequality constraints. For example, when you have nine rules similar to Person(age > 10), Person(age > 20), …​, Person(age > 90), then you can have similar nine alpha nodes. The default value of the threshold is based on the related advantages and overhead. However, if you configure a smaller value for the threshold, then the performance can be improved depending on your rules. For example, you can configure the drools.alphaNodeRangeIndexThreshold value to 6, enabling the alpha node range index when you have more than six alpha nodes for a precedent node. You can set a suitable value for the threshold based on the performance test results of your rules. Enable join node range index The join node range index feature improves the performance only when there is a large number of facts to be joined, for example, 256*16 combinations. When your application inserts a large number of facts, you can enable the join node range index and evaluate the performance improvement. By default, the join node range index is disabled.
